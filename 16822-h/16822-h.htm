<h3>ANNOUNCEMENT OF DEATH.</h3>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">December</span> 23, 1891.<br />
</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Meredith</span>, of Virginia: Mr. Speaker, I rise to make
the painful announcement to the House of the death of Hon.
<span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span>, a Representative in the Fiftieth and
Fifty-first Congresses of the United States and a Representative-elect
to the Fifty-second Congress.</p>

<p>He died at his home, in Fairfax County, Va., on the 15th day
of October last, after a lingering illness. Later in the session
I shall ask this House to fix a day when his colleagues and
friends can do justice to his memory and express their appreciation
of his high character.</p>

<p>It is only meet and fitting on this occasion that I should say
that in the death of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> the State of Virginia has lost
the services of one of her most chivalrous and noble sons, and
the district he so well represented a faithful guardian of the
interests of all its people.</p>

<p>I send to the desk and ask the adoption of these resolutions:</p><p><span class='pagenum'>[4]<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span></p>

<p>The Clerk read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Resolved</i>, That the House has heard with deep regret and profound sorrow of the
death of Hon. <span class="smcap">W.H.F. Lee</span>, a Representative from the State of Virginia.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Clerk be directed to communicate a copy of these resolutions to
the Senate.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That as a further mark of respect the House do now adjourn.</p></div>

<p>The resolutions were unanimously agreed to.</p>

<p>And accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 37 minutes p.m.) the
House adjourned until Tuesday, the 5th day of January next.</p>

</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>. The Clerk will report the special order.</p>

<p>The Clerk read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Resolved</i>, That Saturday, February 6, beginning at 1 o'clock afternoon, be set apart
for paying tribute to the memory of Hon. <span class="smcap">William Henry Fitzhugh Lee</span>, late a
member of the House of Representatives from the Eighth district of the State of Virginia.</p></div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Meredith</span>. Mr. Speaker, I offer the resolutions which
I send to the desk.</p>

<p>The resolutions were read, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Resolved</i>, That the business of the House be now suspended, that opportunity be
given for tributes to the memory of Hon. <span class="smcap">William Henry Fitzhugh Lee</span>, late a
Representative from the State of Virginia.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, As a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased, and in recognition
of his eminent ability and distinguished public services, that the House, at the
conclusion of these memorial proceedings, shall stand adjourned.</p>

<h2><a name="Address_of_Mr_Meredith_of_Virginia" id="Address_of_Mr_Meredith_of_Virginia"></a><span class="smcap">Address of Mr. Meredith, of Virginia</span>.</h2>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: This day having been set apart for the purpose
of paying a last tribute to the memory of one who so lately
was a loved and honored member of this House, I shall, in the
brief remarks which I propose to make, attempt nothing but a
plain and truthful narrative of some of the characteristics and
public services of a Christian gentleman, who in my judgment
measured fully up to that standard which makes man the
noblest work of God.</p>

<p>On the 15th day of October, 1891, at Ravensworth, his beautiful
home in Fairfax County, Va., surrounded by those loved
ones whose constant care and tender nursing had done all that
human power could do to stay the hand of the fell Destroyer,
all that was mortal of Hon. <span class="smcap">William Henry Fitzhugh Lee</span>
passed from this earth, and his noble spirit returned to the God
who gave it.</p>

<p>If the earnest supplications to Almighty God, offered by the
good people of his native State upon their bended knees night
and morning, during the period of his lingering illness, could
have availed, he would have been restored to health and usefulness,
and these melancholy proceedings postponed for many
a long year.</p>

<p>The great sorrow which made the heart of Virginia heavy
and bowed in grief the heads of her true sons and daughters
when the sad intelligence of his death was flashed over the electric
wires was more genuinely spontaneous than were the loud
lamentations of the Roman populace (so graphically described
<span class='pagenum'>[7]<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>by Tacitus) when they beheld the widow of Germanicus, with
her weeping children entering the gates of the imperial city.
Nor was this sorrow confined to those of his own political
faith. Men of all parties vied with each other in their expressions
of regret at his death and in their sympathy for his
bereaved family.</p>

<p>The blameless life he had led, his high character, his gentle
and unassuming manners, won for him not only the respect but
the admiration of all with whom he came in contact.</p>

<p>As gentle as a child and as tender as a woman, with the
courage of a hero and a faith that never faltered, he proved
himself a worthy descendant of that race of famous men from
whom he sprang, and most worthily bore a name which will
be honored as long as a liberty-loving people shall find a dwelling
place upon the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span> was the son of Gen. Robert E. Lee, and
was born at Arlington, on the 31st day of May, 1837.</p>

<p>He was educated at Harvard, where he ranked not only as a
good scholar, but on account of his splendid size and strength
became quite famous in athletics, being "stroke oar" of the
University Rowing Club.</p>

<p>His great ambition was to follow the profession of his father
and to go to West Point; but having had an older brother there,
that fact was considered in those days an insuperable obstacle.
While still at Harvard, completing his education, he was,
through the interest taken in him by Gen. Winfield Scott, who
made the request as a special and personal favor to himself,
appointed in 1857 a second lieutenant in the Sixth Regiment,
United States Infantry, and inaugurated his military career by
taking a detachment of troops to Texas by sea and then by land
up the country to San Antonio.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[8]<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>In 1858 he accompanied his regiment, under the command of
Col. Albert Sidney Johnston, in the expedition to Utah against
the Mormons, taking an active part in that campaign, marching
from Fort Leavenworth to Salt Lake City, and then, when the
troubles were quelled there, traveling on foot to Fort Benicia,
Cal. While on the Pacific coast he received a letter from his
father, written January 1, 1859, in which he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I can not express the gratification I felt in meeting Col. May in New York, and at
the encomiums he passed upon your soldiership, zeal, and devotion to your duty. But I
was more pleased at the report of your conduct. I always thought and said there was
stuff in you for a good soldier, and I trust you will prove it.</p></div>

<p>Resigning his commission in the Army, he came home to be
married to his cousin, a Miss Wickham, and settled down as a
farmer at the "White House" (where Washington met Martha
Custis and was married), a large estate on the Pamunkey River,
left him by his maternal grandfather, G.W. Park Custis, of
Arlington.</p>

<p>When that irrepressible conflict of 1861 was upon us, and Virginia
called upon her sons to defend her soil, he, sharing the
faith of his fathers, in the belief that his allegiance was due to
his State, quickly raised a company of cavalry, and was attached
to the Army of Northern Virginia. Serving in every grade successively
from captain to major-general of cavalry, he led his
regiment in the famous raid around McClellan's army, and was
an active participant in all those brilliant achievements which
made the cavalry service so proficient.</p>

<p>In that terrific fight which occurred at Brandy Station, in June,
1863, he was most severely wounded, and taken to the residence
of Gen. William C. Wickham, in Hanover County, where he was
made a prisoner by a raiding party, and was carried off, at the
expense of great personal suffering, to Fort Monroe. From the
latter place he was conveyed to Fort Lafayette, where he was
<span class='pagenum'>[9]<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>confined until March, 1864, and treated with great severity, being
held, with Capt. R.H. Tyler, of the Eighth Virginia Regiment,
under sentence of death, as hostages for two Federal officers who
were prisoners in Richmond, and whom it was thought would
be executed for some retaliatory measure.</p>

<p>Exchanged in the spring of 1864, he returned, to find his young
wife and children dead, his beautiful home burned to the ground,
his whole estate devastated and laid waste by the ruthless hand
of war; and yet almost his first act on reaching Richmond was
to go to Libby Prison, visit the two Federal officers for whom
he had been held as hostage, and who, like himself, had been
under apprehension of being hung, and shake hands with and
congratulate them.</p>

<p>Immediately joining his command, he led his division in
every engagement from the Rapidan to Appomattox, where,
with his father, the greatest soldier of modern times, he surrendered
to the inevitable.</p>

<p>In a letter written by one of the most brilliant cavalry generals
of the late war, in speaking of Gen. <span class="smcap">W.H.F. Lee</span>, he
uses this language:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He was a zealous, conscientious, brave, and intelligent soldier, who fully discharged
all of his duties. He was one of those safe, sound, judicious officers, and you always
felt when you sent instructions to him that they were going to be obeyed promptly and
to the letter.</p></div>

<p>What greater tribute could be paid a soldier?</p>

<p>Having been married to one of the most accomplished ladies
in Virginia, Miss Bolling, of Petersburg (who, with two sons,
survives him) he removed in 1874 to Ravensworth, and was
the next year elected to the senate of Virginia, where he made
an honorable record.</p>

<p>He was elected to the Fiftieth and Fifty-first Congresses, and
served his State with that fidelity which had characterized his
<span class='pagenum'>[10]<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>every act through life&mdash;faithful, conscientious, and painstaking&mdash;ever
alert to the interests of his constituents and seeking
only how he could serve them.</p>

<p>He was again re&euml;lected to the Fifty-second Congress, and
though by the will of Divine Providence he was not permitted
to take his seat, he will ever be held in grateful remembrance
by his late constituents, and when the long roll of Virginia's
noble and heroic dead is called, the name of <span class="smcap">William H. Fitzhugh
Lee</span> will be mourned by his mother Commonwealth as
one of her noblest and truest sons.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I shall read, as the most fitting
tribute I have seen, an editorial from the Alexandria Gazette
written the day after the death of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Gen. <span class="smcap">William Henry Fitzhugh Lee</span>, second son of Gen. Robert Edward Lee, is
dead. The bells here tolled late yesterday evening. A few hours before the general
had crossed over the river and was at rest under his roof tree at Ravensworth, the
southern sun lighted his deathbed and the autumn breeze sang his requiem. Afterlife's
fitful fever he sleeps well. He was sick a long time, and as his disease was incurable,
death was a relief. No more pain for him now, but the long and peaceful sleep of the
just. His sorrowing family were at his bedside, but he told them not good-bye, preferring
to greet them when they shall rejoin him in a better world. His death is regretted
by all the many who knew him; the more so by those who knew him well.</p>

<p>Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, like his father, was naturally quiet and retiring, and in his intercourse
with others, when right and principle were not involved, invariably acted in accordance
with the rule of <i>noblesse oblige</i>, but when they were involved he was as firm in support
of his convictions as any other man could be. He stood foursquare to all the
winds that blow, but always with the propriety that characterizes the perfect gentleman.
He did his duty to his God, his family, his State, and his country, and did it well, and
executed faithfully all the trusts committed to him in both military and civil life. He
liked the old manners and customs of Virginia, but tried to conform to the new order
of things with becoming grace, and did so with no audible complaint and no useless
repinings. He served his State efficiently in her senate and in the national Congress,
and in the Confederate army he filled, by merited promotion, every position from captain
up to major-general of cavalry. It was different once, but Virginia can ill-afford
to part with such a man now, and in his death, as in that of his illustrious father, she
has lost a true and gallant son, who when not on duty was as gentle as a woman.
Her fame has been increased by having had such a son. May she have many more;
like him.</p></div>

<h2><a name="Address_of_Mr_Edmunds_of_Virginia" id="Address_of_Mr_Edmunds_of_Virginia"></a><span class="smcap">Address of Mr. Edmunds, of Virginia</span>.</h2>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: It is not my purpose to attempt any extended
remarks upon the life and character of Gen. <span class="smcap">William H.F.
Lee</span>, late a Representative from the Eighth Congressional district
of Virginia, yet I can not permit this occasion to pass and
my hand and heart to fail to pay my humble tribute to his
memory. Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>'s life had been spent after manhood in
arms or as a tiller of the soil. In early life he saw military
service as lieutenant in the Sixth Regiment, United States Infantry,
and was with Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston in the expedition
in 1858 against the Mormons.</p>

<p>Resigning from the Army, he returned to his native State of
Virginia and engaged in the pursuit of agriculture. Early in
the late civil struggle he raised a cavalry company, and rose
from the position of company commander to that of major-general,
and followed the cause in which he had enlisted until
the end at Appomattox. There two great military chieftains
met, and one, his illustrious father, gave up to the other his
sword and the mutilated remnant of an army which had fought
with the utmost bravery and fortitude under a leader of unsurpassed
skill and fidelity.</p>

<p>Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, after the struggle had ended, resuming his citizenship
in peace, returned to his farm and occupation of agriculture.</p>

<p>He was elected by his people from his senatorial district
to the legislature. He served one term in the senate of Virginia
and declined a renomination. He was afterwards elected
from the Eighth Congressional district of his State to the Fiftieth
<span class='pagenum'>[12]<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>and Fifty-first Congresses and again returned by his
constituency to the present Congress; but the hand of death
interposed, and he did not live to again take his seat in this
legislative hall.</p>

<p>The name of Lee, Mr. Speaker, has been an illustrious one
in Virginia. No one can with safety challenge the assertion
that that old Commonwealth has furnished, from the time of
the Revolution, as many great men, in peace and in war, as
any of the States of our Union. When the foundations of this
great Republic were laid and constitutional principles evolved,
whether the sword of the warrior or the mind and philosophy
of the statesman were needed, you will find the marks and
handiwork of some son of that State.</p>

<p>Among those great men the ancestry of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> were conspicuous.
He inherited from his great father a disposition
that was frank, manly, and chivalrous. Although with these
distinguished surroundings, Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> had no undue pride,
reserve, or self-assertion. His nature, on the contrary, was
eminently amiable, generous, and sympathetic, and at the same
time he was dignified, manly, brave, and ever courteous.</p>

<p>Identified with the agricultural interests of his State, at one
time president of the State society, and himself a practical and
successful farmer and proud of his occupation, he mingled
freely and congenially with that great class of our citizens upon
whose shoulders repose in great measure the preservation and
safety of the institutions of our common country. While he
was especially devoted to the interests of the farmer, he was
essentially a patriot, and loved his State and all its diverse
interests with an enthusiastic devotion and yearned for her
prosperity.</p>

<p>He was a faithful, able, and vigilant Representative, and had
<span class='pagenum'>[13]<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>in the greatest degree the confidence of his constituents and
the people of his entire State. No one who ever knew him
could fail to implicitly trust him. His State has lost a pure
and noble son; the country a wise, conservative, and faithful
Representative. We who knew him here can recall his manly
robust form, his genial kindly face, his frank accessible address,
his unfailing gentleness of manner, his cheerful friendly
voice, as he walked along the aisles of this Hall.</p>

<p>A man of his character and bearing could but wield an influence
for good wherever his presence was.</p>

<p>In a republic, where the people are the state, the advice, the
suggestions, and the example of a citizen so high-minded and
incorruptible are of great value not only in the councils of
the nation, but in the everyday walks and details of life, in his
beautiful rural home, surrounded by and mingling with his
country people; and it was ever the pleasure and practice of
Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> to associate freely and unrestrainedly with the great
body of the people. His generous and noble heart had a sympathetic
touch with them and their struggles, their callings,
their work.</p>

<p>But he has passed from us under the decree of the great
Master to the great hereafter, leaving the record of a life of
singular purity, directness of purpose, and freedom from guile;
the record of a character unblurred, untarnished, unshadowed
by the least stain; the record of a man high, noble, honorable,
faithful to all the duties and relations of life.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, Virginia, one of the oldest of the Commonwealths,
within whose borders lie the remains of many great
names, and the energies and reserved forces of whose people in
times gone by have risen to great heights, receives to her
bosom her dead son and bows with sincere grief over his
<span class='pagenum'>[14]<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>grave; for to her, whether her hand wore the mailed gauntlet
or followed the gentler pursuits of peace, he had ever been
faithful, loyal, and true.</p>

<h2><a name="Address_of_Mr_Tucker_of_Virginia" id="Address_of_Mr_Tucker_of_Virginia"></a><span class="smcap">Address of Mr. Tucker, of Virginia.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: I shall leave to others the task of portraying
the life of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> in its diversified pursuits, and shall content
myself with the effort of giving to the House my conception of
some of the characteristics of our deceased friend which made
him throughout his life, wherever placed, a conspicuous actor
in private and public affairs.</p>

<p>In the early period of Virginia's history lived William Randolph,
of Turkey Island (a plantation some 15 or 20 miles
from the city of Richmond, near the scene of the terrific
battle of Malvern Hill). He was the ancestor of all of that
name in Virginia, and from him was descended in direct line
Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and Robert E. Lee; the last-named
the father of our departed friend. How could <i>he</i> have
manifested in his life less patriotism, justice, and courage with
such exemplars of these virtues ever before him?</p>

<p>His mother, as is well known, was a descendant from the
wife of Gen. Washington by her prior marriage with John
Parke Custis. Sprung from such a lineage; trained in a
school where the amenities of life as well as "the humanities"
were taught in their highest excellence, he practiced from his
earliest childhood a scrupulous regard for the rights and feelings
of others, and an indulgence to all faults except his own.</p>

<p>With a self-control and equipoise which were never disturbed
under the most trying circumstances, and a graciousness
<span class='pagenum'>[15]<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>of manner which broke down all barriers, giving to the
humblest as well as to the highest the assurance of his friendly
consideration, and a mind well disciplined by education in the
highest schools, it was impossible that he could have been
other than a man of mark and influence in his State.</p>

<p>It is not claiming too much to say that Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was the
natural product of the civilization existing in Virginia during
his boyhood and early manhood, which, alas, except here and
there in certain localities, is fast passing away. The home,
not the club, was its center; the family, not each "new-hatched,
unfledged comrade," its unit. The father was the <i>head</i> of the
family, not the joint tenant with the wife of a house nor the
tenant at will of his wife. The wife and the mother was the
queen of the household, not merely a housekeeper for a husband
and the family. Obedience to those in authority was the
first lesson exacted of the boy. Inculcated with tenderness, it
was enforced with severity, if need be, until the word of the
father or the expressed wish of the mother carried with it the
force of law as completely as the decree of a court or the
mandate of a king.</p>

<p>Reverence for superiors in age and deference to all, rather
than arrogant self-assertion, was magnified as a cardinal virtue,
not as teaching humility and enforcing a lack of proper self-respect,
but rather to exalt high ideals and stimulate an admiration
for "the true, the beautiful, and the good."</p>

<p>Fidelity to truth, the maintenance of personal honor, deference
for the opinions and feelings of others, without abating
one's own or aggressively thrusting them on others; a kindliness
of manner to dependents, a knightly courtesy to all, but
with special and tender regard in thought, word, and action
toward woman, were in turn patiently taught in all the lessons
<span class='pagenum'>[16]<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>of the fireside and at the family altar, and earnestly insisted
upon in the formation of the character of a true gentleman.
"Any man will be polite to a beautiful young woman, but it
takes a gentleman to show the same respect to a homely old
woman" was the stinging rebuke of a father to his son who
failed to remove his hat in passing a forlorn old woman on the
public highway.</p>

<p>The old-field school, the private tutor, the high school, whose
excellence in Virginia I can not praise too much, the college,
the university, led the young mind by easy stages to its full
intellectual maturity.</p>

<p>Nowhere was the principle "<i>Sana mens in sano corpore</i>"
more scrupulously taught than in Virginia. The rod and
stream, the gun, the "hounds and horns," the chase, with the
music of the pack, the bounding steed, all lent their ready aid
in developing the physical manhood of the boy. In the pure
atmosphere of his country home, amid its broad fields and virgin
forests, contracted houses in narrow streets had no charms
for him. To join the chase was the first promotion to which
the boy looked as evidencing his permanent release from the
nursery. The gun and dog became his constant companions,
while "Old Betsey," his father's trusted double-barreled gun
of many years' usage, standing in the sitting-room corner or
hanging on stag-horns or dog-wood forks on the side of the
wall, was the eloquent subject of nightly rehearsals of her
prowess and power in the annual deer hunt "over the mountains."
Skill in horsemanship was essential, and breaking
colts was naturally followed by broken limbs; but manhood
found a race of trained horsemen, both graceful and skillful in
the saddle, unexcelled, I dare venture to assert, by any civilized
people. A child of nature, the Virginia boy communed with
<span class='pagenum'>[17]<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>her as his mother, and from her purest depths drew the richest
inspirations. To him no mountains were so blue as hers, no
streams so clear, no forests so enchanting, no homes so sweet.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While others hailed in distant skies the glories of the Union<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He only saw the mountain bird stoop o'er his Old Dominion.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How vividly the picture comes to me now (never to be
effaced) of a learned professor in one of Virginia's highest
schools, himself three-score years and ten, a soldier of two wars,
as he led the way through a quiet Virginia town on horseback,
followed by two sons, distinguished ministers of the gospel, and
they in turn by a younger son and the grandson of the leader,
with a goodly train of friends, amid the blasts of horns and
baying of hounds, who followed, eager for the chase among
the beautiful hills which surrounded the town of Lexington,
even as the mountains stand "round about Jerusalem."</p>

<p>Religion&mdash;the duty of man to his Creator, not sectarianism&mdash;was
scrupulously taught, and Sunday morning found the family
alive in preparations for attending religious service at Zion or
Trinity, as it might happen to be the first or the fourth Sunday
of the month. From this duty none were exempt from the
least to the greatest. The pastor was the friend on whom all
troubles both temporal and spiritual were cast, and his visits
were long remembered and talked of in the life of each family.
Deference to his wishes and reverence for his character were
well-nigh universal.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A man he was to all the country dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passing rich with forty pounds a year;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[18]<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>Such was the atmosphere in which our deceased friend was
reared. He was a trustee in the venerable institution of Washington
and Lee University at Lexington, Va., founded by Gen.
Washington, and presided over by Gen. Robert E. Lee during
the last years of his life; he was faithful to the trust, and ever
watchful of the best interests of the school. The loss sustained
by this institution in his death has been most fittingly expressed
in the appended minute of the faculty of the university, adopted
on the 19th of October, 1891:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At a meeting of the faculty of Washington and Lee University, held October 19,
1891, the following minute was adopted:</p>

<p>Upon the announcement of the death of Gen. <span class="smcap">W.H.F. Lee</span> the faculty of Washington
and Lee University unite in sorrowful sympathy with his family, bereaved of husband,
father, and brother; with the Commonwealth in the loss of a patriotic citizen;
and with the board of trustees of this university, of which he was an esteemed member.</p>

<p>He was graduated at Harvard for the life of a civilian, but took a commission in the
United States Army as lieutenant, and served with fidelity to duty under Gen. Albert
Sidney Johnston in the Utah expedition of 1858.</p>

<p>At its close he resigned and returned to his country home, where he continued to live
until 1861, when he entered the Confederate army, and, rising by rapid promotion to
the rank of major-general of cavalry, closed his efficient and faithful military career in
1865, when he again returned to country life, and died at the seat of his ancestors, at
Ravensworth, in Fairfax County.</p>

<p>In the mean time his private life was interrupted by the voice of his people, which
called him to their service in the senate of Virginia and for three terms as their Representative
in Congress, two of which he completed, and left the vacancy in the third
by his untimely death.</p>

<p>Truth, honor, and courage to do good and to resist evil, sincerity in all relations
and fidelity to all duty, were heirlooms of his race and lineage, which he kept and left
untarnished to his posterity.</p>

<p>With a mind strong and vigorous, a judgment sound and well-poised, a calm and
self-contained temper, which impelled him to the right and restrained him from the
wrong, and a moral sense which guided and controlled his purposes and his actions
along the path of absolute rectitude, he lived a life adorned by noble virtues and filled
with noble deeds. Gentle but firm, decided, and fixed in his convictions, but respectful
and deferential to those of others, he was a model of all the splendid qualities
which make up the character of a courteous and Christian gentleman.</p>

<p>In addition to all these natural gifts his convictions led him to the profession and
practice of a simple and genuine faith in the religion of Christ.</p>

<p>After an honorable military and civil career, in the peace of God and in charity with
<span class='pagenum'>[19]<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>his fellow-men, this worthy son of an illustrious family died the death of the righteous
and in the hope of immortality through Him in whom he believed and trusted.</p>

<p>The faculty therefore declare&mdash;</p>

<p>That they have heard of the death of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> with deep sorrow, and mourn it as a
calamity to his family, his friends, his country, and to this university.</p>

<p>That they tender to his family these expressions of their affectionate esteem for him
as a personal friend as well as for his service as a public man, and their sincere sympathy
with them in their peculiar and irreparable bereavement.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap right7">Jno. L. Campbell,</span><br />
<span class="right5"><i>Clerk of the Faculty</i>.</span>
</p>

<p>An intimate association with Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> in the Fifty-first Congress
and as members of the board of trustees of Washington
and Lee University at Lexington, Va., and in private life,
enabled me to form a just estimate of his character and of those
personal qualities of head and heart that made him beloved by
all who really knew him. While they have been well expressed
in the foregoing minute, I may add from my own observations
a brief summary of his noble character. His mind was eminently
practical, and arrived at its conclusions more from an
unerring instinct of justice and common sense than through
the exacting processes of logic. His judgment was rarely at
fault, for his intellect was not swerved by passion or prejudice,
but was held in perfect equipoise to receive the truth on both
sides of every question. His deference to the opinions of others
and his caution in seeking the views of those on whose discretion
he relied suggested to some who did not know him that
he was hesitating in temperament. This was not true. He
sought all the light possible on every subject patiently and earnestly,
and when he arrived at his conclusion no man adhered
to it more tenaciously or enforced it more earnestly.</p>

<p>As a speaker, Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> possessed many of the attributes of
the orator, a gift inherited from his grandfather, Light-Horse
Harry Lee. He was graceful in delivery, persuasive in manner,
and forcible in argument.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[20]<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>His diction was pure, unpretentious, and simple. His
speeches were often embellished with references to ancient and
modern history and mythology with which he seemed to be
very familiar.</p>

<p>Dutifulness, I believe, was the most prominent trait of his
character. It was the star by which his life was guided. Once
persuaded that a certain measure or a certain line of policy was
right, and he was unflinchingly firm in its support. No burden
was too heavy, no privation too severe, if only they were borne
along the path of duty.</p>

<p>He exemplified in his life the noble utterance of his distinguished
father: "Duty is the sublimest word in the English
language."</p>

<p>In politics he was a Democrat, but not a partisan, and he
firmly believed that the supremacy of his party was necessary
for the good of the country and the welfare of the people. His
patriotism was exalted, and his faith in the ultimate triumph
of the right never wavered.</p>

<p>His manly appearance, his gracious but dignified manner, his
courtly bearing and pleasing conversation marked him as a gentleman
of the "old school," as one of nature's noblemen.</p>

<p>Any sketch of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> would indeed be imperfect that failed
to mention his love for little children, and his friends will never
fail to recall the tender interest he always manifested in the children
of their families, especially in the youngest.</p>

<p>His life, Mr. Speaker, was a truly noble one. It was on the
highest plane. His character had no spot or blemish upon it
that sweet charity would now consign to oblivion, but it was
robust, well-rounded, and symmetrical, open as day. His ambition
was not to attain but to deserve the praise of the good, and
that higher benediction, to be pronounced by the final Judge of
<span class='pagenum'>[21]<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>the world: "Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou
into the joys of thy Lord."</p>

<p>He was an earnest believer in the Christian faith. The abstruse
doctrines of the church formed no part of his creed. His
faith was in the Christ the Saviour of mankind; a faith which
illumined his pathway in life, lightening his burdens, exalting
his nature, and which sustained him without fear when he met
the last enemy of the race as he walked through "the valley of
the shadow of death." It was the faith of a little child&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">An assured belief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the procession of our fate, howe'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad or disturbed, is ordered by a Being<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of infinite benevolence and power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose everlasting purposes embrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All accidents, converting them to good.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His funeral and burial, Mr. Speaker, will never be forgotten
by those who witnessed it. The autumn sun was fast sinking
behind the bright curtain of the west, bathing "the mellow autumn
fields" of Old Virginia with its purple hues. Untrumpeted
by official authority, scores of friends from city, town, village,
farm, and cabin gathered at Ravensworth to pay the last
sad honor to their beloved friend. White and colored, rich and
poor, high and low, soldiers, citizens, and statesmen, all were
there.</p>

<p>His body was borne from the house to the ivy-clad family
graveyard by the sturdy yeomanry of the neighborhood. In
the presence of that vast throng, with uncovered heads, his
comrades, who had followed him on many a hard-fought battlefield,
performed the last sad rites, and with their own hands
filled his grave and planted upon it the "immortelles" of their
affection and devotion. Faces that never blanched amid the
storm of battle paled; hearts that never quailed in the presence
<span class='pagenum'>[22]<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>of an enemy broke in the presence of the last enemy of us all,
and the silent, pitiless tear which fell from the eye was hidden
by the lengthening shadows of the evening, which were fast
gathering round the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: These occasions of tribute-offering in this
Hall never fail to impress me with extreme sadness, increase
my awe and reverence of Him who holds in the hollow of His
hand every moment we live and every breath we draw, and

<span class="i0">All that lives must die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passing through nature to eternity.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Most naturally am I more than usually touched and pained
by the death of him which now hangs its somber drapery
around the walls of our hearts and casts its pall over this Chamber.
It is a death within the representative circle of which I
am a member. It is the death of a colleague, a friend, whose
presence in that circle always brought sunshine and never
shadow.</p>

<p>Tributes to his memory, clothed in language of beauty and
<span class='pagenum'>[23]<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>breathing with love and burning with pathos, have already
been paid, and others will follow; and now, while I can not
hope to charm with the tongue of eloquence or touch the soul
with the figures of rhetoric, I come with my tribute.</p>

<p>It will be plain and unadorned, but it will at least have the
merit of sincerity, and, like the widow's mite, be all that I can
give.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Henry Fitzhugh Lee</span>, of Virginia, is no more.</p>

<p>How the name of Lee, whenever uttered, wherever chivalry
has erected her altar, sends a thrill like an electric current
through every fiber of the manly man.</p>

<p>How the name of Virginia has been upon every tongue since
Queen Elizabeth, nearly three centuries ago, gave that name
to that section around which to-day historic memories linger
and traditions and glories cluster as thick "as the stars in the
crown of night," the section where Christopher Newport and
his devoted followers "builded an altar unto the Lord and in
the savage wilderness" deposited the germ of this mighty nation,
"and where God blessed them as He blessed Noah and his
sons, saying unto them, 'The fear of you and the dread of you
shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl
of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all
the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.'"</p>

<p>Virginia! The land of legends and lays&mdash;the land where the
cradle of republican liberty was rocked, and where, in 1765, the
first denial was heard of the right of the British Parliament to
levy taxes upon the Colonies which kindled the fire of patriotic
fervor and led to the ever-living, soul-inspiring words of her
Henry and the raising up of her Jefferson to heights of imperishable
fame and her Washington to the pinnacle of everlasting
renown.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[24]<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>Virginia! The land of battlefields and battle gore, colonial
relics and Revolutionary monuments, spotless fame and unsullied
honor; the land of patriot soldiers and heroes, and of a
Yorktown, where the tyrant's head was bruised and the glorious
strife ended which struck from our fathers the fetters and gave
to them and their posterity a country gleaming in the golden
sunlight of republican liberty, and throwing wide open her
gates to the oppressed of every clime.</p>

<p>Virginia! The land of mountains, upon whose summits and
in whose gorges the spirit of freedom roams unfettered and
unconquerable; the land of valleys, which are hung like
alcoved aisles with scenes of heroism and pictures of daring,
self-sacrifice, and devotion to principle; the land of rivers and
rivulets, which reflect like mirrors the fields upon which her
blood has been poured out like water upon the ground; the
land of zephyrs and breezes, and where the storm king sometimes
dwells, gently murmuring or in thunder tones proclaiming
her glories and her fame; the land of blue beautiful skies,
radiant with the virtues of her daughters and bespangled with
the deeds of her sons; the land of memorials of the past, that
inspire the Virginia youth, whether born in poverty or in
riches, reared in the cottage humble or in the mansion stately,
with a patriotism that knows not section and yet a State love
that knows not bounds.</p>

<p>It was in this land that Richard Henry Lee, the fire and
splendor of whose eloquence burned like a hot iron into the
soul of tyranny, and Francis Lightfoot Lee, both of them
signers of the Declaration of Independence, were born; it was
in this land that Arthur Lee, through whose instrumentality
the Colonies secured the friendship and support of France, and
"Light-Horse Harry" Lee, whose legion following his plume,
<span class='pagenum'>[25]<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>struck the enemy in the bivouac, on the march, in the lurid
glare of battle, on the flank, and in the front like a thunderbolt
from the skies, were born. It was in this land that Robert
Edward Lee, whose services on the fields of Mexico decked
his brow with the warrior's laurel, and whose leadership of
the Confederate armies in the unfortunate strife between the
States made his name immortal, and whose virtues shine with
the brilliancy of a polished diamond, wreath his character
in moral grandeur, and draw p&aelig;ans and praises from friend
and foe and from every clime where exalted manhood and a
spotless life find devotees, was born; and it was in this land
that <span class="smcap">William Henry Fitzhugh Lee</span>, whose memory we are
here to perpetuate, was born&mdash;all, all of the same lineage and
blood.</p>

<p>What a line of illustrious and distinguished men of one
name for one State to produce. What a line of illustrious
men to spring from the old cavalier family that under the
reign of Charles I settled in the county of Northumberland,
between the waters of the Rappahannock and Potomac, since
glorified by the pen of the historian and the lyre of the poet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Henry Fitzhugh Lee</span>! How sweet does that
name sound to me. What recollections does it awaken. How
quickly do I find my heart throbbing; how rapidly my blood
rushes through its channels.</p>

<p>Less than a twelvemonth ago he sat in yon seat or moved
hither and thither about this Hall and along these passageways,
pausing here and there to speak a pleasant word or exchange
a friendly greeting. His tall and commanding person,
his open, frank, and benevolent face and courtly bearing
marked him among the membership of this House, and would
have marked him in any assemblage, whether in the glittering
<span class='pagenum'>[26]<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>splendor of royalty or in the plain dignity of our republican
institutions. To see him once was to remember him forever.
His image is as distinct before me this moment as if
he stood in the flesh with his eye beaming forth the goodness
of his nature and his hand outstretched, as was his wont, to
receive mine.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, his illustrious father, when the shadows of
Appomattox closed round him, when the darkness of defeat
enveloped him, when his soul was rent and torn and his mind
was filled with anguish and his ragged and tired and worn veterans,
reduced to a mere thin skirmish line, the remnant of an
army that had shed unfading luster upon the American arms
and the American soldier, gathered with tear-moistened cheeks
about him to bid him farewell and receive his blessing, gave
utterance to a sentiment just quoted by my colleague [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Tucker</span>], a sentiment as grand and noble as was ever written
upon any Roman tablet or carved upon any column of enduring
marble that was ever reared in the flood light of glory:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Duty is the sublimest word in our language.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, thus spoke Robert Edward Lee, the soldier,
hero, Christian, and philanthropist: and when we come to study
the life and character of <span class="smcap">William Henry Fitzhugh Lee</span> we
are impressed with the fact that he took duty as his talismanic
word, that it was the star that guided him, and that he followed
it as faithfully as the "wise men" followed the Star from "the
East" to Jerusalem and thence to Bethlehem.</p>

<p>We believe that in his youth, on the heights of Arlington,
where his eyes first opened upon the light, he learned at his
father's knee and by his father's daily walk and conversation
the great lesson of duty which steered his course and pointed
out his pathway in life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[27]<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>He was born, as has been said, on the 31st day of May, 1837.
In 1857 he was appointed a second lieutenant in the Sixth Regiment
of United States Infantry, and served in 1858 in the then
far West under Albert Sidney Johnston, whose fame Shiloh
echoes and re&euml;choes along the banks of the Tennessee. In
1859 he resigned his commission in the Army and returned to
Virginia and located on his estate in the county of New
Kent. In 1861, when the Southern tocsin sounded and Virginia's
voice was heard calling for troops, he raised a cavalry
company and joined the Army of Northern Virginia. He rose
gradually from captain to major-general of cavalry; was wounded
in the terrific engagement between the Confederate and Federal
cavalry at Brandy Station on the 9th day of June, 1863; was
captured at Hanover Court-House, and was confined at Fort
Monroe and Fort Lafayette until March, 1864, when he was
exchanged, and repaired to his command, and served until the
flag which he loved was furled forever at Appomattox.</p>

<p>From that time forward he cultivated his large estate with
much care, serving one term in the senate of his State, declining
a renomination. In 1886 he was elected to the Fiftieth
Congress from the Eighth Congressional district of Virginia,
and again in 1888 to the Fifty-first Congress, and still again
in 1890 to the present Congress.</p>

<p>It was my privilege and pleasure to form his acquaintance in
the army and to watch his flashing blade amid the carnage of
battle, observe his cool courage and intrepid bearing and the
love and confidence of his men upon more than one sanguinary
field. He was as calm when the leaden hail was rattling and
as cool when the shells were shrieking and bursting as he was
upon this floor. He was a leader, not a follower of his men;
if they went into the jaws of death, he was at their head. He
<span class='pagenum'>[28]<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>fared as his men fared; if their haversacks were empty, his
was empty; if they laid down in the mud, he laid there too; if
they sweltered in the summer heat or shivered in the winter
blast, he sweltered or shivered too; and thus it was he kindled
in the breasts of his men intense love for himself and secured
their implicit confidence in his leadership.</p>

<p>The promotions he received, rising from a captain to a major-general,
speak in terms stronger than any words of mine of his
courage and valor and his qualities as a soldier and military
chieftain.</p>

<p>As a civilian, pursuing the quiet walks of rural life and
devoting himself to agriculture, the noblest of all arts, he was
honored by all the people and drew to him his neighbors, binding
them with the steely bands of constant friendship. His
word was as good as his bond, and the dusky son of toil as well
as the intelligent tenant on his wide possessions relied upon it
with absolute faith; and the most beautiful tribute that could
be paid to his memory was the deep sorrow which manifested
itself in a meeting after his death of those whose brawny muscle
had held the plow-handles and whose toil had made the corn
and the wheat grow on his rich and fertile fields.</p>

<p>In politics he was a Democrat, and he was as pure in the
political arena as in private life. He scorned the ways of the
demagogue and the timeserver, and believed that "men should
be what they seem." In the councils of his State and in the
councils of the nation he was found at all times in full accord
with the principles and policy of his party.</p>

<p>As a Representative he was as true to his constituents as any
subject to his sovereign, laboring in season and out of season
to serve them, and even when his strong frame began to weaken
and the germs of disease had been planted in his system he disregarded
<span class='pagenum'>[29]<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>the warning calls for rest and continued to bend all
his energies in the discharge of his trust, and I but speak the
truth when I say that he fell a martyr to duty.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, while he was grand as a soldier, pure as a
man, exalted as a citizen, and faithful as a Representative, it
was in the home circle, as husband and father, and not on the
battlefield, in civil life, or in the halls of legislation, that the
beauty and loveliness of his character drew a halo around
him.</p>

<p>He loved home, and it had a charm for him which neither
pleasures, honors, nor fame could pluck from his bosom.
Blessed by the companionship of one worthy of all adoration,
and who presided like a queen over his household, entering
into all his joys, sharing all his sorrows, and encouraging all
his aspirations, he loved the breezes that kissed her cheeks, the
birds that made sweet music to her ear, the rivulets that gently
murmured her name, the flowers that shed their fragrance in
her bowers, and the stately oaks under which the children of
their union had prattled and the pebbled walks upon which
they had played and gamboled.</p>

<p>Yes, he loved home, and in its sacred circle his presence was
like a sunbeam, brightening every face and warming every
heart. He was all patience, gentleness, kindness, and love, and
if there ever was a home which was a fit emblem of heaven it
was Ravensworth, the home of this distinguished man.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, he is gone. He lives now only in memory.
In October last, when the frosts were blighting and the leaves
were falling and the autumnal winds were sighing, after patient
waiting for the fatal hour it came, and God's finger touched
him, and the brave soldier, honored citizen, faithful Representative,
devoted husband, and affectionate father was dead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[30]<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>He passed away quietly, strong in Christian faith and in the
hope of a blissful eternity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Henry Fitzhugh Lee</span>! His State mourns his
death. Within the bosom of her soil he rests&mdash;peacefully
rests. In his ancestral land near by Arlington, historic, revered
Arlington, the scene of his childhood and early manhood, he
sleeps&mdash;sleeps the sleep that knows no waking.</p>

<h2><a name="Address_of_Mr_Wise_of_Virginia" id="Address_of_Mr_Wise_of_Virginia"></a><span class="smcap">Address of Mr. Wise, of Virginia</span>.</h2>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: In accordance with a beautiful and impressive
custom we put aside for to-day our legislative duties to pay a
tribute of respect to the memory of Hon. <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span>,
of Virginia. In November, 1890, he was elected to serve as a
member of this Congress from the Eighth district of that State,
receiving in that action of his devoted constituents a merited
indorsement of his conduct and services as their Representative
for the two preceding terms. But when the day of our assembling
arrived my colleague was not present to answer to the call
of his name. He had passed over the river and was resting under
the shade of the trees on the other side. He was beloved and
honored by all the people of Virginia, and the announcement
of his death, which occurred on the 15th day of October, 1891,
was received everywhere within her borders with expressions of
<span class='pagenum'>[31]<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>the deepest sorrow. He was born at Arlington, on the Virginia
heights, opposite this beautiful city, on the 31st day of May,
1837, and at the time of his death was in the fifty-fifth year of
his age.</p>

<p>In 1857, when he was pursuing his studies in the University
of Harvard, in preparation for the active and serious duties of
life, he received from the then President of the United States
the appointment of brevet second lieutenant in the Sixth Infantry.
At that time the spirit of resistance to the authority of the
National Government was being exhibited to such an extent in
Utah as to call for measures of repression. Assassinations and
outrages of all kinds were common, and the officers of the United
States were powerless either to prevent or punish their commission.</p>

<p>When Mr. Buchanan became President the resolution was
formed that the insubordination and conflict of authority existing
in that Territory should cease, and the necessary executive and
judicial officers having been appointed for the enforcement of the
laws of the United States and the preservation of the public peace,
it was determined to send a detachment of the Army to protect
them against violence and to assist them as a posse comitatus,
when necessary, in the performance of their duties. Gen. Albert
Sidney Johnston became the commander of this military force,
and Lieut. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> had his first experience of the service in this
expedition. As the occasion does not call for a recital of the
events of that period, I will content myself with the remark that
he was then, as on every occasion in after years, faithful to the
obligations of duty. His term of service in the Army was of
short duration, and from that fact we may infer that he was not
enamored with the life of a soldier in time of peace.</p>

<p>In 1859 he resigned his commission, and soon thereafter was
<span class='pagenum'>[32]<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>married to Miss Wickham, the daughter of a family distinguished
in the annals of Virginia. They went to reside at the White
House, on the Pamunkey River, in the county of New Kent.
It was at this old historic country home that the marriage of
George Washington with the Widow Custis was celebrated. It
descended to Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> from his mother, who was the great-granddaughter
of Washington's wife.</p>

<p>Here he devoted himself to the tillage of the soil and became
engrossed with the pursuits of a plain and unostentatious
farmer. His condition and surroundings at this time were
such as to invite contentment and encourage the cultivation
of those pure and lofty sentiments for which he was ever distinguished.</p>

<p>Being in the flower and strength of his young manhood and
blessed with affluence and the love of an accomplished wife,
there seemed wanting nothing to make his home an earthly
paradise.</p>

<p>But the course of this peaceful and happy life was not to run
thus smoothly to the end. Dark and threatening clouds of war
soon lowered upon our land, and the political conflicts and antagonisms,
which had grown in intensity and bitterness with
the flight of years, ripened into civil war in 1861. The crisis
then arrived when the appeal to arms was inevitable, and with
it the necessity that all men should decide whether allegiance
was first due to the State or General Government. There were
honest differences of opinion on this question, which had existed
from the very foundation of the Republic.</p>

<p>He was connected by blood with a long line of illustrious
men, who had borne a conspicuous part in the events which
led to the declaration of American independence and the establishment
of this constitutional Government. It was Richard<span class='pagenum'>[33]<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
Henry Lee who offered in the Continental Congress, in June,
1776, that stirring resolution which proclaimed to the world
"that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free
and independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance
to the British Crown; and that all political connection
between them and Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally
dissolved."</p>

<p>It was his own grandfather, known in history as "Light-Horse
Harry Lee," who, in the long struggle which followed this
bold declaration, struck such sturdy blows for the liberties and
rights of his countrymen as caused him to receive the special
commendation of George Washington, of whom in turn he
uttered those memorable words: "First in war, first in peace,
and first in the hearts of his countrymen." Bearing a name
thus associated with all the glorious achievements of the past, it
was but natural that he should have felt an ardent attachment
to the Union. But he was a son of Virginia, "where American
liberty raised its first voice and where its youth was
nurtured and sustained."</p>

<p>There the doctrine of the sovereignty of the State was accepted
as the true interpretation of the Constitution almost
without division of sentiment. Her people held that allegiance
was first due to their State, and while all deplored the
necessity for, few, if any, doubted as to the right of separation.
When in April, 1861, a convention representing her people
passed the ordinance of secession, he felt no hesitation in adopting
his course. He resolved at once to consecrate himself and
his sword to the sacred duty of defending her homes and firesides.</p>

<p>Having raised a company of cavalry, he was made its captain,
and was rapidly promoted from rank to rank until he reached
<span class='pagenum'>[34]<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>that of major-general. Soon after his entry into the Confederate
service he became associated with the command of Gen. J.E.B.
Stuart, and participated thereafter in nearly all the movements
of that fearless and dashing leader, whom the brave Gen.
Sedgwick, of the United States Army, pronounced "the best
cavalry officer ever foaled in North America." On June 3,
1862, Gen. Robert E. Lee, the father of my deceased colleague,
assumed the command of the Army of Northern Virginia three
days after the retiracy of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, caused by a
wound received in the battle of Seven Pines.</p>

<p>The plans of the Federal commander for the capture of the
capital of the Southern Confederacy had been well chosen. His
army, according to his own report, numbered 156,000, of whom
115,000 were ready for duty as fighting men. All the vast resources
of his Government were being employed to enable him
to prosecute his campaign with efficiency and vigor. His
troops had been furnished with artillery and small arms of the
most approved description and best pattern. They had abundance
of ammunition of the finest quality and ample supplies
of food and clothing. Gen. McDowell, then at Fredericksburg
with 40,000 men, and Gens. Banks and Fr&eacute;mont in the valley
of Virginia, were expected to co&ouml;perate in the movement. A
line of fire was slowly but steadily being drawn around Richmond.
These plans, as I have said, had been well conceived
and were being executed with great precision and skill.</p>

<p>To oppose this formidable advance there were less than 100,000
fighting men in Virginia, and they were greatly inferior to the
enemy in both equipments and supplies. Gen. Johnston, penetrating
the designs of his adversary, commenced operations to
prevent their accomplishment. The bloody and stubbornly
contested battle of Seven Pines was fought in part execution
<span class='pagenum'>[35]<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>of his plans. When Gen. Robert E. Lee succeeded to the command
it was apparent that some decisive blow must be struck
to save the Southern capital from a state of siege. Surveying
the whole field with a keen and practiced eye, he saw that the
left wing of the Union army, which had been thrown across the
Chickahominy and advanced to within four or five miles of Richmond,
occupied a strong and almost impregnable position. An
attack upon the center promised no better results.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances he turned his attention to the
right wing, and, in order to obtain the fullest and most accurate
information concerning McClellan's position and defenses on
that portion of his line, ordered Gen. Stuart to make a reconnoissance
in the direction of Old Church and Cold Harbor.
With 1,500 picked men that pink of Southern chivalry immediately
undertook the execution of the orders of the commanding
general. This daring exploit was popularly known as
"Stuart's ride around McClellan." It is a fact that he did
pass entirely around the Union army, and, building a bridge
across the Chickahominy, re&euml;ntered the Confederate lines in
safety. In this perilous expedition he was assisted by his bravest
and best officers, among whom were Gens. <span class="smcap">William H.F.
Lee</span>, and his cousin, the dashing Fitz Lee.</p>

<p>More was accomplished than had been anticipated, and it was
ascertained that the right and rear of McClellan were unprotected
by works of any strength. In consequence of the information
thus obtained the decision was formed to make the
attack in that direction, and on the 26th of June, 1862, began
that series of splendid battles which culminated in the retreat
of McClellan's army to Harrisons Landing, on the James
River, and the deliverance of Richmond from danger. On the
9th of June, 1863, there occurred near Brandy Station, in the
<span class='pagenum'>[36]<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>county of Culpeper, Va., one of the most extensive and stubborn
cavalry fights of the whole war. Two divisions of Federal
cavalry, commanded by Gens. Buford and Gregg, and supported
by two brigades of "picked infantry," fell upon Stuart
with such suddenness and fierceness that the attack was
almost crowned with victory. Nothing saved him from defeat,
if not from greater calamity, but his own coolness and that of
his lieutenants, coupled with the indomitable pluck and intrepidity
of his troopers.</p>

<p>In this engagement that brave Georgian Gen. Young, formerly
a member of this House, by a splendid charge with
sabers, without carbine or pistol, repulsed a dangerous and
gallant assault on the rear, while Gen. <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span>,
with equal courage and dash, protected the left of the Confederate
position. In this encounter Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> received a severe
wound, which necessitated his retirement from the field. He
was carried to Hickory Hill, in Hanover County, the home of
Gen. Wickham, a near relative of his wife, and here he was
captured and placed in solitary confinement in Fort Monroe
as a hostage, certain officers of the United States being then
held under sentence of death in Libby Prison in retaliation
for the execution of certain Confederate officers in the West.</p>

<p>Gen. Custis Lee, being then a young unmarried man, on the
staff of the Confederate President, met, under special flag of
truce, representatives of the Government at Washington, and
begged to be permitted to take the place of Gen. <span class="smcap">William H.F.
Lee</span>, giving as a reason for the proposed exchange his
desire to save from punishment the innocent wife and children
of his wounded brother. The offer was declined, and he was
told that the burdens of war must fall where chance or fortune
placed them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[37]<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>In this incident we have a beautiful and touching illustration
of the strength and warmth of brotherly love and of the
knightly bearing of the Lees of Virginia. While thus detained
as a prisoner of war, racked with physical suffering
and those mental tortures which a sensitive and high-strung
man must feel under such circumstances, there came the sad
tidings of the death of his loved wife and two children; and
thus was added another, the most poignant of all the griefs
with which he had been afflicted. His old Virginia home,
associated with so many sacred memories, had been reduced to
ashes, and now there remained of the once happy family which
formerly occupied it only the captive father. This weight of
woe would seem too much for human endurance, but he bore
it with the fortitude of a Christian soldier. He was exchanged
in the spring of 1864, and returning to his division, led it in
all the engagements, from the Rapidan to the Appomattox,
where the curtain fell upon the stirring and bloody scenes in
which he had been such an active participant.</p>

<p>As a soldier he was always calm, cool, and self-possessed.
Those who have had experience in the ranks know that the
bravest and best soldiers will falter and hesitate when they are
without confidence in the ability, judgment, and foresight of
their leader. The soldiers who were ranged under the standard
of Lee, believing that their noble commander was equal
to all emergencies, followed him with unwavering trust, and
their survivors testify to the affection in which a spirit so gentle
and yet so brave was held.</p>

<p>No higher eulogy can be pronounced upon any man than to
say of him that which can be truly alleged of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, that
he was an honored and trusted leader in that splendid Army of
Northern Virginia, which only failed where success was impossible.<span class='pagenum'>[38]<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
They challenged the respect and admiration of the
world, and of their great captain it has been said that "a country
which has given birth to men like him and those who followed
him may look the chivalry of Europe in the face without
shame, for the fatherlands of Sidney and Bayard never
produced a nobler soldier, gentleman, and Christian than
Robert E. Lee."</p>

<p>These meager details of our civil war have not been given
with the purpose of reviving unpleasant memories or of perpetuating
sectional animosities. They have been related because
they constitute an important part of the story of the life
of him whom we mourn.</p>

<p>On both sides were displayed the highest qualities of the
military leader, and illustrated as never before the pluck, endurance,
and dash of the American soldier. They were Americans
all, and, without distinction of sections, we can claim
part of the honor of their achievements and partake in the
pride of their great names. We have furnished to the world
the indubitable proof that these States united are invincible.
When, at Appomattox, our arms were stacked and banners
furled we returned to our homes with no divided allegiance.</p>

<p>We believe that in the safety of the Union is the safety of the
States. And we rejoice that "the gorgeous ensign of the Republic
is still full high advanced, its arms and trophies streaming
in their original luster, not a stripe polluted or erased, not a
single star obscured, bearing for its motto no such miserable interrogatory
as 'What is all this worth?' Nor those other words
of delusion and folly, 'Liberty first and Union afterwards,' but
everywhere, spread all over in characters of living light, blazing
on all its ample folds, as they float over the sea and over the
land and in every wind under the whole heavens, that other
<span class='pagenum'>[39]<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>sentiment, dear to every true American heart, 'Liberty and
Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.'"</p>

<p>But while entertaining these sentiments, we can not, we will
not, forget our glorious dead. The brave men against whom
we fought neither expect nor desire such unnatural conduct.
Whether the cause for which they died was just or not it would
be idle to discuss. It is enough for us to know that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They were slain for us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their blood flowed out in a rain for us&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red, rich, and pure, on the plain for us;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And years may go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But our tears shall flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the dead who have died in vain for us.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After the cessation of hostilities Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> resumed the occupations
of a farmer on the old plantation which he had left in
1861. The implements of warfare were exchanged for those of
the husbandman, and following the plow on the furrows he commenced
the work of repairing the losses he had sustained. In
1868 he married Miss Mary Tabb Bolling, the daughter of Col.
George W. Bolling, of Petersburg, and they continued their residence
at the White House until 1874, when they removed to
Ravensworth, in the county of Fairfax, where he died.</p>

<p>He was an able and faithful Representative, and always devoted
to the interests of his constituents. As a fitting eulogy to
his worth it may be truly said that it was his disposition to
follow the line of duty to the end. The conscientious performance
of every trust confided to him was the watchword of his
life. In his conduct as a legislator he was never ruled by faction
or interest, but the promotion of the public good was the motive
of all his actions. While exhibiting none of the showy and
sparkling qualities of the orator, he was distinguished for the
possession of good judgment and strong practical common sense.<span class='pagenum'>[40]<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
He was a man of calm and even temperament, and was seldom,
if ever, controlled by prejudices or swayed by passion. Those
who were associated with him here remember his dignified and
courteous bearing. No words of bitterness or reproach ever
escaped his lips, and he never forgot what was due to others as
well as to himself.</p>

<p>I never heard him speak an unkind word of another, and
while reserved, and to a certain extent formal, in his demeanor,
he was a man of infinite sweetness of disposition:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thus he bore without abuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grand old name of gentleman.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Both in his public and private life he furnished an example
worthy of the emulation of all who love the true nobility of
humanity. We will draw aside the curtain only for a passing
glance at the domestic circle, of which his beautiful and lovely
wife was at once the pride and the ornament. Surrounded by
this devoted helpmeet and two manly sons, there was not a
happier home in old Virginia. Warmed by the love of his big
and generous heart, it was the abode of contentment and peace.
The dread messenger was never more unwelcome than when he
entered the portals of Ravensworth and made vacant forever the
chair of the husband and the father.</p>

<p>We can say nothing to assuage the poignant grief of the widow
and children, but our hearts are filled with the fervent prayer
that Heaven's choicest blessings may be showered upon them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: In this brief tribute to the memory of Gen.
<span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span> I should be unworthy of the friendship
which it was my privilege to claim did I indulge in anything
else than the language of soberness and truth. In him there was
no manner of affectation; he pretended to be nothing but such
as he was, and it is certain that if he had been giving directions
to his biographer he would have laid down the rule announced
by Thomas Carlyle, in his review of the life of Lockhart,
that the biographer in the treatment of his subject "should
have the fear of God before his eyes and no other fear whatever."</p>

<p>Froude, as biographer, claims subsequently to have applied
to the life of Carlyle his own rule; and all the world knows
that in the portrayal of Carlyle's faults of character the biographer
left many a sting in the hearts of those who had loved
the great man while he lived and who felt that the failings on
which the historian had dwelt ought to have been interred with
his bones. The biographer who shall perform faithfully the
task of writing the life of <span class="smcap">"Rooney" Lee</span> will not paint him
as a genius like Carlyle; but, sir, if there was any single
feature in the character of our friend that, laid bare to the world
even by the bold hand of an Anthony Froude, would cause the
faintest blush to tinge the cheek of family or friends, I, who
knew him well, do not know what it was.</p>

<p>It is true, sir, that it was not my fortune to be thrown in
contact with him in the earlier years of his life. I did not
know him when his character was being shaped and molded
<span class='pagenum'>[42]<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>by the generous and refining influences which surrounded him
from his cradle to his manhood.</p>

<p>My personal acquaintance with him may be said to have
begun only when he had taken his seat by my side in this Hall.
But his fame had come before him. A representative of the
most distinguished family in America, he had been, by this
circumstance alone, conspicuous from his birth; and yet he
came among us with not a spot upon his name.</p>

<p>During the civil war, from a subordinate position rising rapidly
to high command and always in the bright light that
surrounded him as a son of the most illustrious general of
modern times, he bore himself as a soldier without reproach.
Neither in civil life nor in war had calumny assaulted him.
Such a man, entering here upon a new career, attracted attention
the moment he came into this Hall.</p>

<p>It soon appeared to those who watched him closely that he
was singularly modest. This modesty was not diffidence. He
was at all times self-poised. On this floor, addressing himself
to a public question just as in a private conversation among
his friends, he always had the easy, unpretentious manner of
the thoroughbred gentleman, but his modesty was easily apparent
in an utter lack of self-assertion. He never put himself
forward except when duty prompted, and then he did nothing
for display; never a word did he speak for himself, but only
for his cause.</p>

<p>He made indeed no pretensions to oratory; he had never
been trained in its arts; but his mind was broad and highly
cultured, he had a vast fund of vigorous common sense, and he
expressed himself readily and pointedly. With these faculties
he would in time have taken rank as a strong debater.</p>

<p>While broadly patriotic, he had at the same time a high
<span class='pagenum'>[43]<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>sense of obligation to his immediate constituency, and he was
patient to a remarkable degree. His district, you will remember,
Mr. Speaker, lay just beyond the Potomac.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter for his constituents to come to the
Capitol, and naturally many of them sought office at his hands.
I sat near him in the Fifty-first Congress. Often have I known
him to be carded out a dozen times a day; and if he ever
expressed himself to me as worried by these interruptions he
never failed to show by what he said that his annoyance arose
not so much from the importunities of his friends as from his
inability to serve them.</p>

<p>In address he was remarkably pleasing. Indeed, his manner
was so genial, so pleasant, so hearty and sincere, that the memory
of his kindly greeting will not be forgotten until the whole
generation of his friends shall pass away. Who is there among
his associates on this floor that will ever cease to remember
him as, morning after morning in the springtime, he came into
this Hall, bringing from his home a basket of roses to distribute
among his friends? He was not seeking popularity. Such a
thought had not occurred to him, nor did it enter into the mind
of anyone here. He simply loved his friends, and he loved
flowers just as he loved all things beautiful and true.</p>

<p>Such a man could not but be, as Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was, a model
brother, husband, and father. In all his life nothing was more
lovely and beautiful than his family relations.</p>

<p>He had about him none of the arts of the demagogue; he
was always true to himself, and therefore never false to any man.
His whole walk and conversation illustrated that he was the
worthy son of his noble father; that from his youth up he had
profited by the precepts and example of that illustrious chieftain,
who declared, in those memorable words already quoted by my
<span class='pagenum'>[44]<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>eloquent friend [Mr. Tucker], that duty was the sublimest word
in the English language. And, Mr. Speaker, let me say that
the idea conveyed by this word duty, as taught by the father
and practiced by the son, was far higher than that ideal, lofty
though it was, expounded by philosophers like Plato and
Cicero. With the Lees duty meant Christian duty.</p>

<p>With all these characteristics Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> could not but grow
and continue to grow as he did in power and influence in a body
like this; and had he been spared for that long career in this
Hall hoped for by his friends he would have risen to eminence
as a legislator.</p>

<p>But this was not to be. He has passed away from us forever.</p>

<p>When such a man dies out from among us, let critics cavil as
they may about time wasted in memorial addresses. We should
do violence to our own feelings did we not pause to honor his
memory; we should do wrong to the American people, whose
heritage they are, did we not spread before them the lessons of
his life, that the whole country may venerate his virtues and
the youth of the land may emulate his example.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: Of all picturesque spots on the face of the earth
there is perhaps none that can rival in scenic beauty Mount
Arlington, in the State of Virginia. Shaded by the primeval
forest to the rear, and in front beautified by the gently sloping
lawn, decorated by variegated flowers and artistically trimmed
shrubbery, with the dark-green waters of the Potomac ebbing and
flowing not far away and in full view the mighty nation's
splendid capital city, stands the stately old mansion, with its
<span class='pagenum'>[45]<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>classic columns, where nearly fifty-five years ago was born our
departed friend and colleague, and one of the beloved Representatives
of the people of Virginia&mdash;Gen. <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span>.
Born in Virginia, he remained a Virginian continuously to the
hour of his death.</p>

<p>Inheriting the martial genius of his eminent ancestry, he
early aspired to a career in the military service of his country,
and at the comparatively early age of twenty we find him bidding
adieu to his college studies at Harvard and uniting with
the Army in its expedition to Utah in 1858, where he first experienced
the fatigues and hardships incident to the life of the
soldier in the long march over the arid plains and through the
mountain canyons into the Mormon territory. The prospect of
inaction, with a long period in garrison, proved a disappointment
to so ambitious a spirit, and he resigned his commission
and returned to the domestic welcome of his Virginia farm.</p>

<p>Soon, however, the indication of a long peace proved delusive,
and the scene shifted. This time it was decreed that he
should behold the terrible conflict in which one portion of his
unhappy country was to engage in deadly array with another
portion. Obeying what he conceived to be the mandate of his
State, he followed the impulse of his feelings and the example
of his kindred and his friends, and periled all in that belief.
He participated at once, and most actively, in some of the most
sanguinary engagements of the civil war. Wounded at one
place, taken prisoner at another, then exchanged, and again in
the van of battle, we find him following the forlorn hope until
the close of the struggle at Appomattox, when he again returned
to the old farm.</p>

<p>He possessed the undivided confidence of his constituents.
He was regarded by them, as he was so long observed by us
<span class='pagenum'>[46]<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>in our intimate associations with him in this Hall, and especially
in the committee rooms, as an intelligent and conscientious
legislator, a laborious servant of the people, a courtly gentleman,
a generous and devoted companion. Loyal as he was
to his political convictions, he was yet the most considerate
and the most conservative in his relations with those who radically
differed with him. He admired frankness; he despised
duplicity. While he was obedient to the reasonable edicts of
caucus and party organization, we recall occasions when he was
prompt to rise above the partisan. He was as broad-gauge and
comprehensive in the study and performance of his duty toward
all parts and all interests of his reunited country as he was
anxious for the obliteration of sectional animosity and sincere
and generous of heart in his social obligations to all of his
fellow-men.</p>

<p>The most touching remembrance we bear of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>'s
goodness of heart has reference to his custom in springtime of
bringing to this Hall from his farm great quantities of lovely
roses, and having them distributed to his associates of both
political parties on this floor with his compliments. Here we
have a practical illustration that flowers are the interpreters of
man's best feelings. In oriental lands the language of flowers
was early studied and made expressive. As Percival says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each blossom that blooms in their garden bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On its leaves a mystic language bears.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> they bore tidings of good will to partisan
friend and partisan foe alike. They bespoke in mute eloquence
the expansive heart of one "that loved his fellow-men." Little,
however, did he think at the time that these beautiful roses
were especially speaking to him as emblems of a near immortality.
Awakening from their sleep of winter, they were also
<span class='pagenum'>[47]<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>harbingers of a brighter day to him and of the bloom of a glorious
resurrection. The Germans have a saying that "he who
loves flowers loves God." If this be applied to Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, we
have the blessed assurance that he has approached close to the
celestial throne.</p>

<p>Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> belonged to one of the most historic families of
America. Looking back to the early settlement and the pioneer
struggles of the peninsula and then through the plantation
and colonial period of entire Virginia, we everywhere discover
the genius, the dauntless courage, the independence, and the
resolute patriotism of the Lees. It has been well said, sir, that
Virginia is the mother of Presidents; and this is true. A
momentary reflection does not suffice to demonstrate the various
causes which combined to bestow upon the Old Dominion this
prominence. A mature study, however, will serve a double
purpose. It will teach us not only how Virginia more than
any other State became the nursery for Presidents and statesmen,
but how at the same time were given character and fame
to its distinguished family&mdash;the Lees.</p>

<p>The permanency and prosperity of states and political bodies
are as much due to the character of their superstructures as
are the strength and stability of the material edifice to the
foundation upon which it rests. The Argonauts of Virginia
united in a remarkable degree the pride and culture and learning
and loyalty of the Cavaliers with the conviction of purpose
and martial courage and discipline of the followers of Cromwell.
First came the heroic vanguard&mdash;the men like Capt. John
Smith&mdash;who blazed the way through the forests of the James,
the York, the Chickahominy, and Pamunkey. Then followed
the refined, enthusiastic, and chivalric gentlemen of the polished
court of Charles I, with many of the clergy, who brought with
<span class='pagenum'>[48]<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>them their intense loyalty to the Crown, as well as to the episcopal
government and Anglican ritual. Among these, too,
were the proselyted royalists; old and honorable families after
the defeat of Charles, seeking exile in the far distant yet faithful
Virginia. Then came those who triumphed at Naseby, and
overthrew the kingly office and maintained the constitution of
the realm and the integrity of Magna Charta and the Petition
of Rights.</p>

<p>The necessity for self-defense and the maintenance of order
originated self-government and the assertion of individual right,
and these united the widely variant elements of the community
in a loyal union. It was the amalgamation of such spirits in
Virginia in 1676 which demanded the right of personal liberty,
of universal suffrage, and of representation; and here was fought
the prelude of that great drama one hundred years later, when
a Virginian, in the name of a whole nation, penned the immortal
words which proclaimed to all the world the "inalienable
right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Here were
the Lees, the Patrick Henrys, the Randolphs, the Jeffersons, the
Madisons, and the Masons of Virginia; and here, to close the
drama with freedom's triumphant army, was the most illustrious
of them all&mdash;George Washington. It was from such an
ancestry our late colleague was descended, and it was from such
teachings and such examples he imbibed his zealous convictions
of right and his sturdy regard for the exalted prerogatives of a
free people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: On the 15th of last October death again invaded
the ranks of this House. The mysterious messenger laid
the summons of his cold silent hand upon one who had immeasurably
endeared himself to all whose good fortune it had
been to know him. To-day we pause amid the rush of a nation's
public business to mourn the country's loss and to pay a just
tribute to the noble dead. When such a man as our late colleague,
Gen. <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span>, is taken from our midst, a void
is made which can nevermore be filled. It is not his visible presence
or his tangible body that we shall so much miss. It is the
magnetism of a pure mind, the silent, potent influence of a spotless
character, the power of a great, good, and noble soul to elevate
and dignify all with whom it came in contact that will
prove our irreparable loss. No man ever associated with Gen.
<span class="smcap">Lee</span> without feeling the better for it. To have been with him
made you feel like one who had drawn a long deep inspiration
of pure fresh air into his lungs after breathing the stifling atmosphere
of a close room. His thoughts, his conversation, his
ideas diffused about him a sound and healthy morality, that was
as natural to him as its delicate odor is to the rose. Modest and
gentle as a woman; sympathetic as a child; guileless as the
day; a logical, well-trained, accurate mind; a horror of injustice;
absolutely devoid of resentment; a benignant countenance, and
a splendid physique, made him indeed a man among men.</p>

<p>Sir, I believe not only in early training, but in the force of
early surroundings and family traditions. Sprung from an illustrious
line of statesmen and patriots, who had left their impress
<span class='pagenum'>[50]<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>on every page of the history, civil and military, of this country
from the colonial days to the present; born on those beautiful
heights overlooking this city at Arlington, where the house was
filled with the sanctified relics and the very atmosphere he
breathed in childhood was pregnant with the traditions and
precepts of "the Father of his Country;" his mother being the
daughter of George Washington Parke Custis, the adopted son
of the immortal Washington; his father that world-renowned
military commander, the self-poised, calm, patient, dignified,
glorious Gen. Robert E. Lee, it would be unnatural not to expect
to find the impress of all these on the heart and mind and
character and life of Gen. <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span>.</p>

<p>To some my words of eulogy may appear fulsome; but having
known him in public and in private, at home by his own fireside,
as well as abroad on the active field of life, I know that my poor
words can but fail to do full justice to his true worth. With
him the performance of duty was accompanied by no harsh
word or cynical expression; on the contrary, his calmness and
uniform sweetness of manner were almost poetical. I recall a
notable instance in the Fiftieth Congress, when, pressing under
the most trying circumstances the passage of a bill for the relief
of the Episcopal high school near Alexandria, he was temperate
and patient. Standing on the Republican side of this Hall,
among those who questioned him, his words fell softly and
evenly as snowflakes on the turbulent House, which finally by
an almost unanimous vote passed his bill.</p>

<p>He shrank from publicity; therefore he never spoke on this
floor unless it was necessary to push a measure intrusted to his
charge; then he always acquitted himself with credit. In the
committee and among his colleagues his influence was irresistible,
because his judgment and integrity were above dispute.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[51]<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>With him a public office was a public trust, which he accepted
and administered for his State and his constituents without regard
to race, color, or party affiliation. Many times have I seen
him, when coming in from his country home in the morning,
met at the depot by a dozen or more of his constituents, claiming
his attention to their private matters with the Departments
of the Government.</p>

<p>The patience and tender care with which he heard and looked
after each were paternal and pathetic. His love for little children
was intense and beautiful. Nothing made him happier
than to fill some little fellow's hands and pockets with candies
and fruits, claiming only in return a shy caress. In his home
is where his perfectly balanced Christian character shone in its
brightest light. As father and husband he was indeed a model
man.</p>

<p>I shall attempt no extended biographical sketch; that has
already been well done by others. Yet I can not refrain from
saying that in every stage of his career Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> did his whole
duty, actuated entirely and solely by the loftiest motives.</p>

<p>A graduate of Harvard at twenty, he was appointed a second
lieutenant in the regular Army. Often I have heard him tell
of the wearisome march across the plains to California with his
regiment, long in advance of civilization and railroads, when
most of that journey through the desert was made perilous by
roving bands of hostile Indians. Retiring from the Army, he
married and settled at the historic White House, in lower Virginia.
There he was the typical Southern country gentleman of
refinement and culture, taking an active interest in agriculture
and the public affairs of his community. When the war between
the States summoned Virginia's sons to her defense he
again became a soldier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[52]<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>Throughout the struggle he discharged every duty and was
equal to every responsibility placed upon him. His soldiers
loved and trusted him as a father, for they knew he would
sacrifice no life for empty glory. The saddest chapter in all his
life was when&mdash;a prisoner of war at Fort Monroe, lying desperately
wounded, with the threat of a retaliatory death-sentence
suspended over his head, in hourly expectation of its execution&mdash;he
heard of the fatal illness of his wife and two little
children but a few miles away. Earnestly his friends begged
that he might be allowed to go and say the last farewell to them
on earth. A devoted brother came, like Damon of old, and
offered himself to die in "Rooney's" place. War, inexorable
war, always stern and cruel, could not accept the substituted
sacrifice, and while the sick wounded soldier, under sentence
of death, lay, himself almost dying, in the dungeon of the Fort,
his wife and children "passed over the river to rest under
the trees" and wait there his coming. Yet no word of reproach
ever passed his gentle lips. He accepted it all as the
fortune of war.</p>

<p>In all the walks of life&mdash;as a student at college, as an officer
in the regular Army, as a planter on the Pamunkey, as a leader
of cavalry in the civil war, as a farmer struggling with the
chaos and confusion that beset him under the new order of
things following the abolition of slavery, as president of the
Virginia Agricultural Society, as State senator, and as a member
of Congress&mdash;Gen. <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span> met every requirement,
was equal to every emergency, and left a name for honor,
truth, and virtue which should be a blessed heritage and the
inspiration for a nobler and loftier life to all those who shall
succeed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: It is not my purpose at this time to make any
extended remarks upon the life and public services of the late
Gen. <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span>. Other gentlemen of the House,
more intimately acquainted with Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> in his lifetime, are
better prepared to do justice to his memory than I am. But
having enjoyed a very pleasant acquaintance with the deceased
during his four years' service as a member of this body, I desire
to express the great respect which I entertained for him as a
gentleman of high character and of noble, manly qualities.
Descended from one of the most highly honored families in the
State in which he had his birth, he was liberally educated, and
at an early age entered the Army as a second lieutenant and
served as such until 1859, when he resigned his commission
and returned to the peaceful pursuits of civil life. In 1861 he
followed his illustrious father, and entered the service of the
Confederate States as a captain of cavalry. That he was a
brave and gallant soldier there can be no doubt, for his military
history shows that he rose step by step from the rank of a
captain to that of a major-general of cavalry. In 1865 he surrendered
with his father at Appomattox, and renewed his allegiance
and devotion, as I am glad to believe, to the Government
of the United States.</p>

<p>I can but wish, Mr. Speaker, that such honored names as
those of Gen. <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span> and his distinguished father
had never been led into rebellion against the Government of
their country. But they felt it to be their duty to follow the
fortunes of their State, and let us to-day, while mourning the
<span class='pagenum'>[54]<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>departure of our deceased friend, rejoice that the surrender at
Appomattox has been followed by a restored Union, and that
our reunited, undivided country is now one of the strongest,
most powerful, and prosperous of all the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>As a Representative in this body, while he was not inclined
to participate actively in the discussion of public and political
questions, still Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> took great interest in all that pertained
to the public welfare, and especially in that which, in his judgment,
was in the interest of his immediate constituents. He
was an able, faithful, and efficient Representative as well as a
noble, manly man, and in all my intercourse with men I never
met a more genial, warm-hearted, pleasant gentleman than the
distinguished citizen to whose memory we pay tribute to-day.
I well remember his kindly greetings, and I am sure all of us
who knew Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> deeply regret his loss as a member of this
body, to which he was for a third time elected by his confiding
constituents, and extend to his sorrowing bereaved family our
warm heartfelt sympathies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: I have not been in the habit of speaking
upon occasions of this kind, but it is one of the joys of my life,
a very great joy indeed, to feel that I had a place in the heart
of the gentleman whom we are now commemorating. I knew
him very well, and in many respects I regarded him as one of
the most fortunate men whom it was ever my pleasure to know.
While many men here are struggling for fame, while many of
them will leave the struggle heartsick, weary, defeated, he
had that power, that charm, so precious and so lovely, of attaching
<span class='pagenum'>[55]<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>men to him by the ties of affection. Little children
loved him.</p>

<p>There was a benignancy, a sweetness of demeanor, which
attracted them to him, and while his name may not be
sounded in the trump of fame, yet the subtile power of his gentleness
and goodness has permeated many lives, will shape
many destinies, and will have a force in the history of the
world greater than that which will be exerted by many who
will succeed him here. He was a soldier, yet he was gentle
and kind. He was a descendant of a long line of honored ancestry,
yet he did not believe that mere wealth was necessary
either to respectability or to greatness. He was a farmer and
loved the soil. He looked upon the ripened grain as the
flower of human hope and as a minister to human needs. He
loved the breath of cattle, and he regarded the occupation of
an agriculturist as the noblest and the best in which a man
could be engaged. He was a true son of the soil&mdash;hearty, simple,
gentle, true.</p>

<p>But, sir, the particulars of his career, both public and private,
have been recounted by those who knew him well; have
been recounted with great force, with great eloquence and
propriety. There is, however, one part of that career to which
I wish to refer. He was engaged in the memorable struggle
which convulsed this nation from center to circumference and
which fastened the gaze of the civilized world. I wish upon
this occasion to say emphatically, that wherever we may have
stood in that struggle, whatever was good and great in any
man participating on either side of it is a precious heritage to
the entire American people to-day. We proved that, North,
South, East, West, we had not degenerated in the qualities
which make a nation great.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[56]<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>Grant and Lee, Sherman, Sheridan, and the two Johnstons
have gone from us forever, and every day the green sward of
peace, the flowers of affection, are placed above the grave of
some hero of the blue or the gray. But I love to think that
above these graves stands the Genius of American freedom,
serene and grand, and bids the world behold how brave the
sons of the Republic were in the past; how united they are in
one purpose and one destiny in the present; how certain they
are to be a people noted for reasonable liberty, for perfect
union, and for sufficient material power to be formidable and
just alike to the other nations of the earth.</p>

<p>And so, sir, I come and lay the flowers of my Northern
home upon the bier of this son of Virginia, this good citizen,
this patriot, this man who, I am proud to believe, held even
me in his affection. And when gentlemen here speak of the
terror and the mystery of death, I tell them that to such a man
death has no terrors, and that to the good man it has no
mystery; for in that illimitable hereafter, which must be populated
by all the sons of men, it must be, it will be, well with
all of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: The House has already heard from his friend
and successor the story of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>'s life. I shall not, therefore,
repeat it even in briefest outline. Enough for me to say
that he was one in a long lineage of noted men, who by some
innate force and virtue had stood forth in three generations as
leaders of their fellow-men; that he was the son of the greatest
of all who have borne the name, and that in early manhood
<span class='pagenum'>[57]<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>he exhibited the soldierly instincts and the soldierly capacity
that seemed to be historically associated with it.</p>

<p>With such a lineage and with such a history he came to this
House, and I believe I can offer no higher tribute to his memory
to-day than to say that in all his associations with us here
he was the embodiment of gentleness and modesty. Indeed,
Mr. Speaker, as I now recall Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, and explore with aching
heart the memory of a close and cordial friendship with
him, I can say with confidence that in the blending of these
rare traits I have never known his equal. They were a part
of his nature, not more illustrated in business and social intercourse
with fellow-members than in his relations with the page
who did him service and who learned to regard himself in some
way as the special friend and associate of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>.</p>

<p>Many of us doubtless can recall the evident pride of the
little fellow who occasionally placed upon our desks the roses
which his kindly patron brought by the basketful in the spring
mornings from his Virginia home to brighten the sittings of
the House. And this gentleness and modesty were the more
attractive because they were the adornment of a sincere and
manly character. How much came to him as the rich legacy
of ancestral blood and how much was wrought into his nature
by the training of his youth it is idle to speculate. In both
respects he was lifted far above the common lot of men. Of
his mother it is said by those who knew her well that she was
one of the most accomplished and at the same time most
domestic, sensible, and practical of women. Of his father's
influence and teaching, to say nothing of his lofty example,
we have the striking proofs, if any were needed, in letters that
have been published. Let me cull but an occasional expression
from these unaffected outpourings of the heart of Robert E.<span class='pagenum'>[58]<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
Lee toward the son he loved so well. "My precious Roon," as
he was wont to call him.</p>

<p>When the boy was not yet ten years of age he closes a playful
letter, adapted to such tender years, with these earnest words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Be true, kind, and generous, and pray earnestly to God to enable you to keep His
commandments and to walk in the same all the days of your life.</p></div>

<p>A year later, writing from the ship <i>Massachusetts</i>, off Lobos,
to his two sons, a letter full of interest to boys, he urges them
to diligence in study:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I shall not feel my long separation from you if I find that my absence has been of
no injury to you, and that you have both grown in goodness and knowledge as well as
in stature; but how I shall suffer on my return if the reverse has occurred. You enter
into all my thoughts, into all my prayers, and on you in part will depend whether I
shall be happy or miserable, as you know how much I love you.</p></div>

<p>Ten years later, when the son had become a lieutenant in the
Army, he admonishes him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I hope you will always be distinguished for your avoidance of the universal bane
whisky and every immorality. Nor need you fear to be ruled out of the society that
indulges in it, for you will acquire their esteem and respect, as all venerate, if they do
not practice, virtue. I hope you will make many friends, as you will be thrown with
those who deserve this feeling. But indiscriminate intimacies you will find annoying
and entangling, and they can be avoided by politeness and civility. When I think of
your youth, impulsiveness, and many temptations, your distance from me, and the ease
(and even innocence) with which you might commence an erroneous course, my heart
quails within me and my whole frame and being tremble at the possible results. May
Almighty God have you in His holy keeping. To His merciful providence I commit
you, and I will rely upon Him and the efficacy of the prayers that will be daily and
hourly offered up by those who love you.</p></div>

<p>A year or two later, on New Year's Day, 1859, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I always thought there was stuff in you for a good soldier and I trust you will prove
it. I can not express the gratification I felt, in meeting Col. May in New York, at the
encomium he passed upon your soldiership, your zeal, and your devotion to your duty.
But I was more pleased at the report of your conduct; that went more to my heart and
was of infinite comfort to me. Hold on to your purity and virtue; they will proudly
sustain you in all trials and difficulties and cheer you in every calamity.</p></div>

<p>So, too, when the young lieutenant had married and settled
down a typical Virginian farmer upon the estate left him by
<span class='pagenum'>[59]<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>his grandfather Custis, the well-known "White House" on
the Pamunkey, the home of Martha Washington:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am glad to hear that your mechanics are all paid off and that you have managed
your funds so well as to have enough for your purposes. As you have commenced, I
hope you will continue never to exceed your means. It will save you much anxiety
and mortification and enable you to maintain your independence of character and feeling.
It is easier to make our wishes conform to our means than to make our means
conform to our wishes. In fact, we want but little. Our happiness depends upon our
independence, the success of our operations, prosperity of our plans, health, contentment,
and the esteem of our friends, all of which, my dear son, I hope you may enjoy to the
full.</p></div>

<p>With such counsels, glowing with a father's love and enforced
by the constant example of a father's life, it is no wonder that
the son grew into the manliness, the gentleness and modesty,
the charitableness of judgment, the unconspicuous and patient
devotion to duty, and the personal lovableness of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I might say much more from the promptings
of a strong and unfeigned affection and from a sense of the public
merits of our late colleague, but where there are so many to
speak, it is not necessary for one to attempt a catalogue of his
private virtues and of his public services.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may fitly add a word in closing as to Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>'s
military career. From a captain of volunteer cavalry he rose
on his own merits at the age of twenty-six to the rank of major-general.
I have not searched the annals of war to recite his
military history, for it is not the soldier that I have been commemorating,
but I may recall a testimony not improper to be
placed on record here to-day. I happened to be in company with
Gen. Joseph E. Johnston about the time that Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was first
nominated for Congress. The old commander, who, as all
know, was not given to effusive speech, expressed to me his
hearty gratification at the event, and in doing so his high estimate
of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> as a man and of his ability as a soldier. His
<span class='pagenum'>[60]<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>praise was strong and unstinted, and no one will question its
sincerity. Mr. Speaker, what more need I add than to say that
in all the acts and relations of life, as son and soldier, as husband
and father, as private citizen and as Representative of the
people, as friend and as Christian, our departed colleague left a
memory we may well cherish and an example we may well
follow.</p>

<h2><a name="Address_of_Mr_Cummings_of_New_York" id="Address_of_Mr_Cummings_of_New_York"></a><span class="smcap">Address of Mr. Cummings, of New York</span>.</h2>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: Great as is our country, its history is comparatively
brief. Though brief, it is exceedingly instructive.
So far as there can be an outcome in ever-recurring events, it
is the outcome of a tremendous social and political struggle.
Sir, it hardly suits the occasion to refer to the origin of this
struggle or to trace its progress, but the effort for popular government
is discernible through many centuries. As we come
nearer to our time it becomes more intelligent and determined.
Our great Declaration was its best pronunciamento. Our written
Constitution was its most concise expression. The events
that produced them founded a normal school for patriotism.
In it was perfected a new departure. Fealty to lord and king
was supplanted by fealty to human rights. Proclaimed in
the council chamber, these rights had to be won in the field.
Yorktown completed our first endeavor at nation-making;
we graduated masters at Appomattox. The first proclaimed
the prowess of the Confederation, the second testified to the
strength of the Union. Both astonished the world. Both
transpired in Virginia.</p>

<p>Conspicuous in this analogue of our history were the Lees of
Virginia. They have a lineage too illustrious for praise. Its
<span class='pagenum'>[61]<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>escutcheons are too bright for adornment. It reaches back for
centuries loyal to honor and to truth. Him we mourn to-day
was a gifted scion of that great name. His highest distinction
was won in Confederate arms.</p>

<p>Thank God, I can now speak of our civil war with satisfaction
and not with reluctance. I allude to it with a satisfaction
akin to that one feels in gazing upon a plain fertilized by an
inundation. Flowers spring up, birds sing, and golden grain
nods in the sunlight. But our civil war was more like an
upheaval than like a deluge. It shook every timber in the
grand structure with which we had surprised the world. Other
governments have fallen of their own weight; our matchless
edifice could not be shattered by an explosion.</p>

<p>Both contestants stood guard over the popular principle and
would not let it be mined. They were instructed in the same
school and by the same teacher. Local privilege was as strong
with the one as with the other. The dispute was whether the
Union should endure the strain of the race and slavery issue.
The long and vexing argument was adjourned to the battlefield.
In no other respect was our system even threatened. This
close connection at the root made the angry divergence begin
to assimilate at the very outset.</p>

<p>So kindred was it, that when Grant met his heroic opponent
at Appomattox he says that he fell into such a reunion with
him that he had twice to be reminded of the occasion that
brought them together. He then conformed to it, and treated
those who surrendered not as conquered, but as reclaimed.
Lincoln went further. He found a Confederate legislature
ready-made to his hand, and promptly permitted it to repair
the situation. In thus mingling the gray with the blue he
was neither color-blind nor purblind. He knew what he was
<span class='pagenum'>[62]<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>doing. He desired to blend them, as emblematic of a more
perfect Union. Possibly the Confederate legislature suited his
purpose best.</p>

<p>After this testimonial it looks to me something like treason
to that great name to try to exclude Confederate worth from
the annals of the strife or from the glory of its grand consummation.
Neither act nor actor can be profitably spared.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the other day in this very Hall I laid a chaplet
on the bier of a dead comrade. To-day I am trying to commemorate
the virtues of a Confederate colleague. Both died
while members of this House. That both were my countrymen
warms my heart. As my countrymen I can make no
invidious distinction. If living neither would permit it, and
he is more reckless than I who would profane the memory of
either.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have said that I could speak of the civil
war with satisfaction and not with reluctance. The occasion
prompted me to say so. The occasion requires that, as a Union
soldier, I should state my reasons. We learn from experience,
and war is the toughest kind of experience. When it raised
its horrid front and began its work of seeming devastation, we
shrank back from its terrible promise. The world looked to
see us dismembered; but the great Republic, like a daring
cruiser, emerged from the tempest sound from keel to truck.
Not a brace swung loose, not a plank was sprung, no spar was
shivered. Within there had to be readjustment. Aloft the
Stars and Stripes rose and fell in graceful recognition of the
trial. The thunder of her broadsides proclaimed the value of
this object-lesson in nation-making.</p>

<p>We had learned a juster appreciation of ourselves as a whole
people, and if this were all, it was worth the tuition. But we
<span class='pagenum'>[63]<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>had besides garnered into our storehouse of knowledge vast
consignments for the use of liberal economic government. We
had infused into our laws, our language, and our institutions
new vigor for conquest and for human enlightenment. Venality,
that dogs great efforts, undoubtedly there was. But the high
tide of the conflict showed no mercenary taint. On both sides
it was urged from the highest motives of patriotism and of
honor and in defense of the popular principle. That principle
with us means local self-government and representative
union. The rebel yell was because they thought local government
in peril. The Federal huzza was for representative
union. Together they were cheering the same deeply embedded
sentiment.</p>

<p>Those who would study the phenomenon must remember
that where opinions approximate on parallel lines, but from
some interest or sentiment refuse to coalesce, the passions are
liable to ignite. Fusion then takes place in a terrible heat.
The heat must be sufficient to remove the obstacles that the
mass may become unified. We have as a result a firmly established
representative union of local self-governments. The
cooling and finishing process has left no flaw. Sir, what sort
of a soldier must he be who is not proud of having been tempered
in such a trial? If after the unmatched tournament this
is not the spirit of victor and vanquished, then the lights of
chivalry are burnt out and magnanimity is no more.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I know of no greater praise of a life than to
say it was one of honest endeavor. Whatever faculties comprise
it, this is the scope of human duty. When to this is added
a conscience adequate to all the suggestions of a great and busy
career, the sum of human excellence has been reached All
this I believe in my soul can be truthfully said of <span class="smcap">"Rooney"</span><span class='pagenum'>[64]<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
<span class="smcap">Lee</span>. "Rooney" was his father's term of endearment, which
all who knew him, without distinction of age, race, or sex, delighted
to apply to him when absent. When present, it was
always "general." A thorough soldier, there was an idyllic
strain in his nature. He was essentially rural in his tastes.
He loved the wheat fields and tobacco plantations of his native
State. Its very air seemed to inspire him.</p>

<p>The Blue Ridge was to him the perfection of natural beauty.
He was warm in his friendships and true to his kinships. Always
dignified, there was a heartiness in his greetings that was
irresistible. He was as broad as his acres. Riding or driving
over his vast estate or in its vicinity, his cheerful halloo rang
in the ears of those who had not seen him, and the cheery swing
of his hat, though paid to all, was a cherished compliment. If
the spirit of mortal be proud, it was not his spirit. Courteous,
sympathetic, unobtrusive, patriotic, knightly, and beneficent,
he was a part of the soil of Virginia itself. He had the loving
hospitality that would take all into the march of progress. How
much of these qualities was innate, how much he drew from his
high lineage, how much from the teachings of his illustrious
father, can never be known, but he blended them in a halo that
will not soon fade from his memory.</p>

<p>Sir, others have spoken of the incidents of his life and of his
unabated fidelity to its claims. I can not add to his record. I
have met him in battle array; I have embraced him with a soldier's
warmth. We entered Congress together; we have fought
here side by side. It has fallen to my lot to eulogize him. This
I will venture: It would mar the catalogue of bright names of
which America is so proud if his were omitted from the roll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: Truly "in the midst of life we are in death."
There is scarcely one of the associates and colleagues of Gen.
<span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span> who knew him here and up to the closing
days of the late Congress who would have been deterred by the
thought of personal risk from exchanging the chances of life or
death with him for a few months; and yet, in so short a time
the dread summoner, who soon or late is to call us all, has taken
him from this life into that which fadeth not, neither does it die.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The hand of the reaper<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Takes the ears that are hoary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the voice of the weeper<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But our flower was in flushing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When blighting was nearest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yes, death, the unsolved and unsolvable mystery, has enveloped
him, and he has passed from our view never more to be
seen and known of men on this earth. But yesterday the living,
moving, brave, sympathetic, generous friend, and now, alas,
but a memory&mdash;and yet a memory dear to all who knew and
appreciated his noble attributes of heart and mind; a memory
which has left its impress upon his fellow-men for nobility of
character; a memory which can not wholly fade, but must influence
for good not only his own immediate posterity, but all
those who may come after him.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> began in the early part of
the war between the States. It was upon a night march, as we
rode with the advance guard of the army, where we might expect
<span class='pagenum'>[66]<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>at any moment a hostile volley. He related to me in a low
impressive tone of voice an experience which had occurred to
him when his command by reason of surprise had met with
some disaster. What impressed me most at the time was that,
although others must have been to some extent culpable, he
took all the blame upon himself, and had not a word of complaint
for either officer or man who served under him.</p>

<p>This trait of magnanimity, such a splendid companion to
personal courage, I found afterwards to be characteristic of the
man.</p>

<p>Though springing from a long line of heroic and patriotic
ancestors, he had not a particle of pretentious pride, but to all
men, privates in the ranks as well as officers, so that they were
but brave and good soldiers, he always found "time enough for
courtesy." He never tried to appropriate another man's laurels,
but he possessed in a high degree that quality of courage
which is so well described by Emerson:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Courage, the highest gift, that scorns to bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mean devices for a sordid end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Courage, an independent spark from Heaven's bright throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which the soul stands raised, triumphant, high, alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great in itself, not praises of the crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above all vice, it stoops not to be proud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Courage, the mighty attribute of powers above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which those great in war are great in love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spring of all brave acts is seated here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As falsehoods draw their sordid birth from fear.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his friendship he was gentle and tender as one who is full
of love and human sympathy. You might have thought him
better fitted for the paths of peace, and yet upon the battlefield
he was brave as the bravest. Whenever and wherever duty
called him his personal safety was by him never considered.
Often have I seen him in the thickest of the fight, by his presence
<span class='pagenum'>[67]<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>and personal direction cheering and encouraging both
officers and men. Though the son of the general in chief of
the army, he took no favor by it.</p>

<p>He never took advantage of his rank to keep to the rear and
send his regiments in. You could always measure his estimate
of you by the manner in which he met you. The soul of candor,
his heart shone in his eye, and placing a high estimate
upon manhood, he loved all in whom he recognized it. For
about two years during the latter part of the war I served in his
command, and had every opportunity to observe and know him.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with him here was but a revival of old
memories. I always loved him as one who&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Spake no slander; no, nor listened to it.</span>
<hr style='width: 15em; margin-left: 0em; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;' />
<span class="i0">Who reverenced his conscience as his king.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Who, if he committed an error or wronged any man, was swift
to redress it; never laying his blame at another man's door.
Who excelled in all the virtues which go to make up a beautiful
private life in all the essentials of faithful friendship and
truthful character; who lived&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Thro' all this tract of years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wearing the white flower of a blameless life.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Think for a moment how much better and happier every one
would be if all men were earnestly to strive to live up to this
high standard and how much of pain would be spared the
world. He was one of the most faithful members upon this
floor; faithful to the public interest, and whenever any proposition
was under consideration which specially concerned his
own people, they always had in him an able advocate and
strong defender.</p>

<p>He is gone! sincere Christian, loving husband and father,
<span class='pagenum'>[68]<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>trusted friend. The life that was given him has been taken
away. The widow and the orphan mourn, and their grief is
our grief; but a merciful Father has given him more than he
has taken away, and this strength and comfort through the
tender mercy of our Saviour is theirs&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: I never had the pleasure of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>'s
acquaintance, so far as I could recall, until he entered this
House as a Representative of the district which lies just across
the river; but there were many things in common between us
which soon caused a kindliness of feeling much warmer
than the frequency of our association would indicate. It happened
that we were almost of the same age, born within a few
weeks of each other, and that on all great questions of the day
we were singularly alike in our opinions, and, if I may use such
an expression, even in our prejudices.</p>

<p>Amid all the trials of life we two found we had adhered to
simple beliefs of those Southern homes in which we were the
reared; that no advance in civilization, no pretense of progress,
had ever obscured our views as to the olden beliefs and the
simpler truths which had been inwrought into our being by
the venerable fathers and beloved mothers with whom we had
been blessed. The substratum of our beliefs was precisely the
same. And we found that we were not ashamed of that substratum,
that we were not given to apologizing for adhering to
so-called "obsolete" traditions or to creeds "that were passing
out of fashion."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[69]<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>We also found that on the political questions of the day we
were similarly in accord. We believed in the same political
principles. And so it was a very rare occurrence that when
the roll was called in this House we were not found voting,
even on what seemed to be trivial matters, upon the same side.
It was not strange that with these coincidences of belief and
with our having both served in the Confederate army and the
local accident of the nearness of our seats which threw us
together, there grew up a regard greater than was indicated by
our association outside of this Hall.</p>

<p>If I were to select in my acquaintance him who, as much as
any other, deserved the title, I would say of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> that he
was a gentleman. All that had concurred in producing him
was of the best. The blood which gave him life, the soil out
of which he grew, the kindly influences which always surrounded
him, the molding powers to which he had been subjected&mdash;all
were of the noblest. A son of such houses, reared
at such knees, influenced by such powers, he passed early under
the influences of Harvard. Later he took his young experience
as a soldier under Albert Sidney Johnston. He began
his civil life in a delicious home, with the love of an exquisite
young wife. And in the Confederate service he was associated
with the best and the bravest volunteers of the Old Dominion
herself.</p>

<p>It was not strange that the product of such influences should
be a gentleman. All that was courageous, all that was loyal
to truth, all that was courteous to those with whom he came
in contact, all that was gentle and kindly was not only the
heritage which he received with his name and his blood, but
it was developed by all the environments which he was so
fortunate as to have surround him. If I were to select a character
<span class='pagenum'>[70]<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>of which it might be said that it was round, without angles,
even without salient points, it would be his&mdash;not because
he was weak, but because the calmness, the serenity, and the
magnificence (if I may use a word that seems to be hyperbolic)
of the equipoise of his qualities made each of them seem less
important than it would have seemed if other qualities had
been less.</p>

<p>It would not be extravagant to apply to him the paraphrase
of the apostolic description of a Christian gentleman&mdash;loving
without dissimulation; abhorring the evil; cleaving to the
honorable; preferring to confer honor rather than to receive it;
earnest in the work of life, and careful of time and opportunity
to labor; hopeful of all good; patient in tribulation; forbearing
to resent trespass; charitable in thought and word, as in deed;
given to hospitality; at peace with his own conscience and with
God.</p>

<p>We live, Mr. Speaker, in a heroic age. I constantly hear
of this being an age of materialism, of the worship of the
"almighty dollar." I challenge all the past, in all the endeavors
of man, to reach a higher level, to equal the heroism
of the age in which we have been called to perform our part&mdash;the
devotion to duty, the readiness to make sacrifices, the willingness
to give all for the truth which have marked our generation&mdash;the
era in which we have to act our part.</p>

<p>This simple, kindly, unaffected, modest gentleman; this
man, with his sweet calm smile, who met us every day, passing
in and out with a certain reticence of modesty, was himself
but the type of the age in which he lived and of the people
from whom he sprang. All modest as he was, he had
given up everything at the call of duty. All simple and
kindly as he seemed to be, he had at the head of charging
<span class='pagenum'>[71]<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>squadrons captured cannon, and with more heroic endurance
had lain without complaint in the cell of solitary confinement.
He carried about with him in the simple modesty of his everyday
life the heart that at a moment's notice was ready to still
its beating at the call of duty; and with the same simplicity,
with the same freedom from ostentation, with the same delicious
smile, he would have walked into the jaws of death if it
had become him as a gentleman to do so.</p>

<p>To live in such an age, to be associated with such men&mdash;and,
thank God, they are not uncommon amongst us&mdash;the bar at
which I practice, the tables at which I sit in the kindliness of
social intercourse, the men with whom I have been blessed
enough to be called into contact, the very strangers who call
on business at my house, rank among them men just like unto
him. I say to live in such an age, to be associated with such
men, to play a part, however obscure, in such drama, make
life worth the living; make the hereafter nobler for him who
has been so blessed.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to-day, in the midst of this the ending of the
nineteenth century, we who will soon pass away, we who are
but the remnants of a generation of war, can proudly hand over
to those who shall come after us the example of lives that in
war feared nothing but God, in peace strove for nothing but
the good of the people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">President</span>: The resolutions just read were passed by the
House of Representatives on the 6th day of February last in
respect to the memory of <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span>, deceased, late
a member of that body from the Eighth Congressional district
of Virginia.</p>

<p>Before asking the Senate to adopt the resolutions it is incumbent
upon me, as one of the Senators from Virginia, as it is in
harmony with my own personal feelings, to submit some remarks
in explanation of their purpose and object; a sad and
mournful duty to be performed on my part.</p>

<p>Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was my immediate successor in the House of Representatives,
and served with ability and efficiency in both the
Fiftieth and Fifty-first Congresses. He was re&euml;lected to the
present Congress, but his career was arrested by that higher
and supreme Power to which we must all yield, and on the 15th
of October, 1891, he departed this life at his home in the county
of Fairfax, and in the midst of his family and friends.</p>

<p>I do not consider it necessary in this presence or on this occasion
to go into much detail touching the life and character of
the deceased.</p>

<p>The full and eloquent tributes paid to his memory in the
House of Representatives show the high appreciation in which
he was held by his associates in that body, and express in far
more fitting terms than I could employ their estimate of his
character, services, and virtues.</p>

<p>Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> came from a distinguished lineage. Two of the
family signed our Magna Charta, the Declaration of Independence,
<span class='pagenum'>[75]<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>and another was Attorney-General under Gen. Washington.</p>

<p>On the paternal side he could refer to his distinguished grandfather,
Gen. Henry Lee, of the Revolutionary army, who was
known as Light-Horse Harry, the commandant of Lee's Legion,
so conspicuous in the annals of that period. His maternal
grandfather was the late G.W. Parke Custis, of Arlington, the
stepson of Gen. Washington, and familiarly called in his day
the child of Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>His father, Gen. R.E. Lee, the chief military figure on his
side in the late civil war, was too well known for comment at
my hands. It is the boast of some of the old baronial families
of England that their ancestors rode with William the Conqueror
at Hastings. To a certain extent the pride of ancestry
is an ennobling sentiment, and Virginians must be pardoned
when tempted to refer to the illustrious names which their
State in the past has furnished to the nation. The name of Lee
has been a household word in Virginia for three generations of
men. In the death of Gen. <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span> the State has
lost one of her truest and worthiest sons and the Federal Government
a faithful and patriotic Representative.</p>

<p>Although acquainted personally with Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> for many
years, it was only within a year or two before his death that I
had the opportunity to appreciate fully the high personal qualities
of the man and to understand the real nobility of his
nature. The more I saw of him the higher became my respect
and admiration. He grew upon me with closer contact and
more intimate association.</p>

<p>I was greatly impressed with his invariable courtesy of manner
and great amiability and kindness of heart, to which was
added a knightly bearing and cordiality of greeting which,
<span class='pagenum'>[76]<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>combined, made Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> with all classes of society an imposing
and attractive figure.</p>

<p>He has gone to his last resting place, mourned by his family
and friends and lamented by an extensive acquaintance throughout
the country. He had filled the measure of his duties in
every respect, and was entitled, as he passed from the stage of
action, to the plaudit, "Well done, good and faithful servant."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">President</span>: My acquaintance with <span class="smcap">William Henry
Fitzhugh Lee</span> commenced in the summer of 1854, when we
met at Cambridge as members of the new freshman class at
Harvard College. He was just then entering his eighteenth
year, was well grown for his age, tall, vigorous, and robust,
open and frank in his address, kind and genial in his manners.
He entered upon his college life with many advantages in his
favor. The name of Lee was already upon the rolls of the
university, for other representatives of different branches of the
family had entered and graduated in the years gone by and had
left pleasant memories behind them. His distinguished lineage
made him a welcome guest in the older families of the
University city, and of Boston, its near neighbor, who felt a
just pride in the historic and traditional associations connected
with the earlier history of the country, and many of the influential
members of the class belonged to such families.</p>

<p>He was rather older than the average age of his classmates,
and his life had been spent amid surroundings that had enabled
him to see a good deal of society and the world, so that he
brought with him into his college life a more matured mind
<span class='pagenum'>[77]<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>and a greater insight than the student usually possesses at the
threshold of his career. He had enjoyed excellent advantages
in preparing for the entering examinations, and was well
grounded in the languages as well as mathematics, so that he
entered the class well fitted for the course of study to be pursued.
Thus, from the first, he was prominent in the university,
and soon became popular among his classmates, and his
prominence and popularity were maintained during his stay
among us.</p>

<p>This was due not to superior distinction in any particular
study or in any one feature of college life, but rather to his
general standing and characteristics. He kept pace with his
classmates in the recitation room, not so much by hard and
continuous study as by his quick comprehension and ready
grasp of the subject in hand and the general fund of knowledge
at his command. He was of a friendly and companionable
nature, and there were abundant opportunities in a large
class to develop this disposition, cultivate social intercourse,
and strengthen the bonds of good fellowship. He had been
accustomed to an outdoor life in his Virginia home, and his
manly training had given him an athletic frame which required
constant and vigorous exercise. This he sought in active sports
on the football ground and in the class and college boat clubs,
where he was welcomed as a valuable auxiliary.</p>

<p>In a large university&mdash;and Harvard had gained that rank even
as far back as those days&mdash;there are various fields of action,
and other honors are recognized than those marked on the catalogue
or contained in the degrees. The graduate who excels
in mathematics, the languages, the arts and sciences, is decked
with the highest honor on commencement day, but there are
unwritten honors given by general consent of classmates to
<span class='pagenum'>[78]<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>those who have developed a superiority in any mental or physical
excellence. When in after life the members of a class
meet on some public college anniversary or gather together at
a reunion and the memories and traditions of college life are
talked over anew, the merits of those who excelled in pleasant
companionship, in kindly bearing, in generous conduct towards
their associates, in outdoor games and sports requiring strength
and dexterity, are pleasant subjects to dwell upon, even if the
possessors failed to stand among the highest upon the roll of
scholarship.</p>

<p>Thus it was that <span class="smcap">Lee</span> established himself among his associates
during the three years that he remained among us, and
though he contented himself with a medium standing in scholarship
and exhibited no ambition to gain a high rank upon the
college rolls, he won the regard and confidence and respect of
all his classmates and held a warm place in the hearts of those
with whom he was most intimate.</p>

<p>Towards the close of our junior year, in the early part of
1857, upon the recommendation of Gen. Winfield Scott, he
received a commission as second lieutenant in the Army, and
was assigned to the Sixth Regiment of Infantry, which was
ordered into active service on the Western frontier, and took
part in the expedition to Utah which was commanded by Col.
Albert Sidney Johnston. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> accepted this appointment,
closed his connection with the college, and our paths in life
diverged for more than thirty years.</p>

<p>In 1887 we both became members of the Fiftieth Congress.
I well remember his coming to me, with kindly face and outstretched
hand, on the first day of our session in December, as I
sat in my seat in this Chamber, expressing pleasure at meeting
me after so many years of separation and satisfaction that we
<span class='pagenum'>[79]<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>were to have opportunities of renewing the acquaintance and
friendship of our early days. Though the exacting duties of
Congressional life gave me fewer opportunities of associating
with him than I could have wished, yet I saw much of him during
the years we spent here together, and I shall always remember
those occasions with satisfaction. Sometimes it was only a
word in passing, a shake of the hand, a brief conference on public
business, but whether the interview was brief or prolonged
his manner and conduct were always kind and friendly and
sincere.</p>

<p>While we were together in Congress he often referred to our
college life and its associations, and remembered them with evident
satisfaction. He became a member of the Harvard Club
here in Washington, and I recall a pleasant evening when he
was one of the after-dinner speakers there. In the summer of
1888 he went to Cambridge, to revisit the old scenes and once
more meet his friends and associates of the olden time. He
attended the commencement exercises and spoke pleasantly at
the class supper. His classmates who then met him will long
cherish the remembrance of that last visit, his hearty greetings,
his cordial manners, the interest he manifested.</p>

<p>The renewal of our acquaintance soon satisfied me that the
experience of life had strengthened and developed all that was
good and noble and manly in the young student. The same
warmth and cordiality which had endeared him to his classmates
won the regard and affection of his associates here. The
same general ability and rotundity of character which had made
him prominent in the little world of college life made him useful
and influential in various lines of duty in the wide field of
Congressional legislation.</p>

<p>During the intervening years the manly bearing, the physical
<span class='pagenum'>[80]<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>superiority, the nobility of spirit which had characterized
him in the earlier days had made him a leader among men
when the storm of war raged over the land. Brief as were the
days of the unacknowledged Southern Confederacy, his name
was enrolled in bright letters upon the pages of its history,
and his brave deeds will in future days be chronicled in song
and story by those who admire true courage and recognize all
that was gallant and noble and heroic in the lives of all those
who fought on both sides of our great struggle as worthy of
preservation and commemoration.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Lee</span> first left college his military duties, as has been
already stated, carried him to the far West, and he there saw
some rough service. The Utah expedition was a training
school for soldiers and generals, and many who afterwards
gained renown and fame, under the different standards were
there associated together in a common duty. Besides the leader
and commander, Col. Johnston, were Robert E. Lee, Hardee,
Thomas, Kirby Smith, Palmer, Stoneman, Fitz Lee, and Hood.
When the Army first entered upon this service there was a small
cloud of war in the horizon, but it soon cleared away, and the
company to which <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was attached was assigned to a dull and
monotonous routine of garrison life. This possessed no attractions
for the young lieutenant, and there were other influences
drawing him towards his native State. He resigned his commission,
returned to Virginia, and settled at the White House,
in New Kent County, where George Washington had married
the widow Custis.</p>

<p>The plantation had descended to her son, George Washington
Parke Custis, and from him through <span class="smcap">Lee</span>'s mother to the
grandson. He soon established his cousin, Miss Wickham, as
queen of this historic home, and he was here with his little
<span class='pagenum'>[81]<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>family amid these surroundings, with everything to make life
attractive, when Virginia and her sister States of the South
passed their ordinances of secession and sent delegates to
Montgomery to unite in the attempt to form a Southern Confederacy.
<span class="smcap">Lee</span> never doubted that allegiance was due first to
his State, and when war followed he drew his sword in defense
of Virginia.</p>

<p>As long as the strife continued he avoided no danger, he
shunned no peril, he feared no adversary.</p>

<p>Now with a company, now a squadron, now a regiment, now
a brigade, now a division of cavalry behind him, he went upon
the march, formed the line of battle, or rode into the enemy's
lines. Whatever duty was assigned to him, he entered upon its
discharge with energy and vigor. In the varying fortunes of
war he was wounded, captured, held as a hostage; but the day
of recovery and exchange came, and he once more headed the
brave followers who loved and honored and trusted him, and
during the last year of the struggle he again shared their
hardships and privations and dangers. But the end came at
last, the issue was settled, the arbitrament of war was decided
adversely, and he sheathed his sword and returned to the place
where his home had been.</p>

<p>The year 1865 marked a low ebb in the fortunes of the
Southern people, and perhaps it may not be unprofitable to
dwell briefly upon their conduct when under the shadow of
defeat and disaster. The distinguished father of him to whose
memory we are this day paying tribute went from the head of
a great army to train the new generation of young men of the
South in the halls of a university to usefulness in the various
walks of citizenship. The students who enjoyed the privilege
of sitting at the feet of this grand college president there
<span class='pagenum'>[82]<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>learned lessons of patriotism. They were advised to build up
the places left waste and desolate, and to look hopefully forward
to a reunited country and a more prosperous future.</p>

<p>Whatever public disappointment or private grief or loss he
suffered was buried in his own breast. He advised his countrymen
that the great questions which had long divided the
country, and upon which opinions had been so diverse that
legislative debate and administrative action had failed in finding
a solution, had been finally settled by the sword, and that
henceforth their duty was to the Union restored and indissoluble.</p>

<p>With so illustrious an example the immediate restoration of
peace and good order all over the South is not to be wondered
at. The annals of all nations may be searched in vain for a
parallel. It is an easy task for men who have accomplished all
they desired to lay down their arms and return to their homes
and resume their former avocations.</p>

<p>The Southern soldier did all this after failure and defeat.
The cause was lost; his efforts availed nothing. The homes
of many were in ashes; sorrow was in every household; many
were stripped of their all. The labor system of the country
was destroyed; commerce was dead. Many had not seed to
plant their lands. The workshop, the manufactory, the shipyard
were silent as the grave. The arts of peace seemed to
have perished. The soldiers were disbanded without the means
of reaching their homes, and the few survivors of those who
went forth with bright hopes, proud and confident in their
strength, returned one by one weary and footsore and disheartened.</p>

<p>The history of other nations would have suggested to the
historian that the result must be open riots and secret assassinations,
<span class='pagenum'>[83]<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>a reign of violence and terror, years of turbulence
and lawlessness, before society would settle down to its former
condition. But how different was the result. The parole upon
which the soldier was released was in no instance violated.
The situation was accepted without a murmur or complaint.
The laws were obeyed. The terms imposed were acceded to.
Soon the busy hum of industry was heard through the land.
The arts of peace were revived. Agriculture and trade once
again flourished, and our fair country began to bloom again
into something like its old-time beauty and prosperity.</p>

<p>There were few Southern soldiers who returned to a greater
desolation than did our late associate, Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>. Fate seemed
to have done its worst. The beloved wife and the two dear
children who had made his home at the "White House" a
paradise had died in 1863, while he was held as a prisoner and
a hostage at Fort Lafayette and Fort Monroe. The place
had been occupied by Union troops; the mansion, with all its
surroundings, had been destroyed by fire, and, as has been well
said by another, there was "not a blade of grass left to mark
the culture of more than a hundred years." Had he been an
ordinary man he would have sunk with the load of sorrow and
trouble which weighed him down. But he had a brave heart,
which defeat and affliction and disaster with united effort could
not conquer.</p>

<p>With the same noble spirit which had actuated his father,
the elder Lee, he threw aside his discouragement and took up
the duties of life and citizenship anew. He had made himself
famous as a soldier; he now began in earnest to cultivate the
arts of peace. It was no easy task, for the era of reconstruction
immediately succeeded the war, and only those who were
actually under its ban can realize the burdens and hardships it
<span class='pagenum'>[84]<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>entailed upon an unfortunate people emerging from a disastrous
conflict.</p>

<p>He rebuilt and re&euml;stablished his home at the White House
plantation. He was married November 27, 1867, to Miss Mary
Tabb, daughter of Hon. George W. Bolling, of Petersburg.
In 1874 the family removed to Ravensworth, in Fairfax County.</p>

<p>At both these places he cultivated his broad acres and interested
himself in all matters relating to agricultural progress
and development. He advanced and promoted these interests
as president of the Virginia State Agricultural Society. He
represented his county for a term in the State senate, but declined
a re&euml;lection, and returned to his plantation and the enjoyment
of home life. After a few years of quiet he was called, in 1886,
to a new field of activity by neighbors and political friends,
who desired his services at the national capital, and he became
the Representative from the Alexandria district in the Fiftieth
Congress, and he was in his third term, when, on the 15th day
of October, 1891, the hand of death removed him from his
career of usefulness. For weeks his strong constitution and
vigorous frame had resisted disease in his Ravensworth home.
All that kindness and skill could suggest was done in his
behalf, but skill and kindness were of no avail, and he bade
adieu to home and family, companions and associates, earthly
duties and surroundings, and entered upon his eternal rest.
His mortal life was closed.</p>

<p>I well remember a day spent in his company nearly four
years ago, and its occurrences gave me an opportunity to witness
the regard in which he was held by those among whom he
had lived and to whom he was best known. It was on Decoration
Day, in a section of country where he had seen service
as a soldier, not far from where he had lived in his early childhood.<span class='pagenum'>[85]<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
He was the orator of the occasion. Many of his old
companions in arms and members of their families were among
his audience, and they listened eagerly as he made appropriate
reference to the departed comrades who slept under the little
hillocks near by them, bright and fragrant with the flowers of
early summer, which the loving hands of woman and childhood
had heaped upon them. As he descended from the platform
he was surrounded by old and young, who thronged about him
to shake his hand or give expression to a friendly greeting.
Admiration and affection were expressed upon their countenances
for the brave man before them, whose gallant deeds had
been told at every fireside in the country around, and who was
loved and honored because, in addition to his own merits and
virtues, he represented the great leader whose name was the
embodiment of a precious memory.</p>

<p>I have portrayed <span class="smcap">William Henry Fitzhugh Lee</span> as a
student, a soldier, a planter, a public man representing his
people in the State legislature and the National Congress.</p>

<p>Some have united in paying tribute to his memory because
they were born and reared in the State which gave him birth,
some because they shared with him the hardships and dangers
of his military career, some because they were associated with
him in Congressional life and committee work. But while I
take a great pride in all that he accomplished in the after
years, it is more pleasant to me to recollect him as the student,
for in that relation I was first drawn into companionship with
him; it was during that period of our lives that I first learned
to regard him, and my tribute is to my classmate and friend
of auld lang syne. May he rest in peace in the bosom of the
honored State he loved so well and served so faithfully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">President</span>: The biography of <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span> has
been furnished by his colleagues and associates. I do not propose
to dwell upon the details of his public or private career,
or that of his distinguished ancestors, who acted so conspicuous
a part in the history of the American Colonies and in the trying
times of the Revolution by which our independence was gained.</p>

<p>I had the good fortune to form the acquaintance of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>
and his estimable wife at the beginning of the Fiftieth Congress.
I was strongly impressed with his noble presence, and his
genial, modest, and dignified bearing. He seemed to me an
ideal specimen of true American manhood. His wife was a
lady whose appearance at once attracted attention and whose
qualities of head and heart charmed and delighted friends and
associates. He was a devoted husband. His tender and gentle
bearing toward his wife were natural and unaffected. The
daily life and conduct of both were a conspicuous example of
the benign influence of a husband and wife who love, honor,
and respect each other.</p>

<p>My impressions of him were so favorable and agreeable as to
create a desire on my part to cultivate his acquaintance and
know more of his character. We met frequently, and discussed
freely the social and political topics which engaged the
attention of members of Congress at the national capital. He
was modest and unobtrusive in the expression of his opinions;
but as I knew him better I was profoundly impressed with the
scope and breadth of his information.</p>

<p>His judgment of men and measures was as free from local
<span class='pagenum'>[87]<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>prejudice and partisan bias as any man's I ever met. He was
induced by his generous nature to attribute good rather than
unworthy motives to those with whom he differed. He was
honest, true, and unsuspicious. On all occasions he expressed
attachment to the Union of the States, and manifested a patriotic
devotion to the Constitution as the charter of our liberties.</p>

<p>He was a brave soldier, and fought on the losing side in a
war that convulsed the continent and astonished the civilized
world; and as a brave soldier he accepted without reservation
the verdict of the war. It is to be regretted that his heroic
services were not on the side of the Union, but the conditions
which placed him in hostility to the flag of the United States
are forever removed. Every cause which produced that terrible
conflict was eradicated and obliterated in carnage and
blood. The horrors of that fratricidal war are now history.
The glorious results achieved are being realized in the abolition
of slavery; in the Union of the States restored, strengthened,
and cemented; in the respect, confidence, and just estimation
of the people of all the sections for each other, and in
the establishment beyond question of the capacity of the citizens
of the Republic to dare and to do in great emergencies what to
all the world seemed impossible.</p>

<p>To-day the virtue, the patriotism, and the renown of the
fathers of the Revolution and the founders of our free institutions
are the common heritage of all the people, both North
and South. The gallant and daring exploits of Legion Harry
or Light-Horse Harry Lee, the grandsire of the deceased, inspire
the same admiration and respect in the sons of the North
as in the sons of the South. It is most gratifying that the descendants
of the comrades in war and associates in council
who gained the independence and established the Government
<span class='pagenum'>[88]<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>of the United States are again united in stronger bonds of interest,
good fellowship, and respect than ever before existed.</p>

<p>Generations to come will enjoy not only the fruits of the Revolutionary
struggle and the establishment of constitutional liberty,
but they will be blessed with liberty that knows no slavery
and with a Union forever indivisible, and they will contemplate
with no partisan feeling the sacrifices which were necessary to
secure such results. The type of manly virtue of which our deceased
friend was a conspicuous example is one of the best fruits
of free institutions. His death in the prime of his manhood and
in the days of his usefulness was a great loss to the country and
a bereavement to his family for which there is no earthly compensation.
But he has left for them in his good name, his unimpeachable
character, and his many virtues an inheritance
more valuable than gold.</p>

<p>He has gone where all must soon follow. The wealth of his
example is an inspiration to the living to emulate his virtues,
enjoy a conscience void of offense, and leave to surviving relatives
the inheritance of an honored name. Such an ambition
is worthy of an American citizen, and the value to humanity
of such a life as that of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> can hardly be overestimated.</p>

<p>Why should death be regarded as a calamity? It is the inevitable
fate of all the living. May it not be a part of life?
The hope of immortality is the greatest boon conferred upon
the living. On an occasion like this words will not soothe the
grief of those who are near and dear to the deceased. Their
consolation must be in the hope of reunion beyond the grave.</p>

<h2><a name="Address_of_Mr_Colquitt_of_Georgia" id="Address_of_Mr_Colquitt_of_Georgia"></a><span class="smcap">Address of Mr. Colquitt, of Georgia</span>.</h2>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">President</span>: It is a difficult and delicate task to draw with
justice and propriety the character of a public man. Fulsome
panegyrics have often been pronounced upon the character of
the dead either out of flattery to the deceased or to gratify the
ambitious desires of the living.</p>

<p>In paying a tribute to <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span> I am not influenced
by any such questionable views. To do honor to his
memory I need only say what justice and truth dictate. There
is little danger, in speaking of him, of committing the offense
of exaggerated eulogy. There is more danger of doing the
injustice of understatement in commemorating a character so
rounded and symmetrical.</p>

<p>As a son, Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>'s filial piety was so marked as to make
him an example worthy of all imitation by the youth of his
country. In every post of honor or trust to which he was called&mdash;and
they were many and exalted ones&mdash;he met his engagements
with such fidelity and courage as never to incur censure
and seldom provoke criticism.</p>

<p>His bearing as a private citizen was of such dignity and benevolence
as to secure the love, while it evoked the admiration,
of all who knew him.</p>

<p>His character was made up of blended chivalry and courtesy
and adorned with the mild luster of a religious faith.</p>

<p>He was frank and open, plain and sincere, speaking only
what he thought without reserve, and promising only what he
designed to perform.</p>

<p>As he was plain and sincere, so he was firm and steady in
his purposes; courteous and affable, he was not influenced by
<span class='pagenum'>[90]<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>servile compliance to his company, approving or condemning
as might be most agreeable to them. He was a man of courage
and constancy, qualities which, after all, are the ornaments and
defense of a man.</p>

<p>He had in the highest degree the air, manners, and address
of a man of quality; politeness with ease, dignity without
pride, and firmness without the least alloy of roughness. He
loved refined society, but he had great respect and sympathy for
those who had been reared in simple habits and the toils of life.</p>

<p>He possessed an even and equal temper of mind. Those
who best knew him can testify of him what has often been
asserted of his great father, that they never heard an acrimonious
speech fall from his lips; that his whole temper was so
controlled by justice and generosity that he was never known
to disparage with an envious breath the fame of another or to
withhold due praise of another's worth.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the friends of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> do not claim for him
brilliant talents and the gifts of genius. It is doubtless a
beneficent ordination of Providence that the best interests of
society are not solely dependent on what in common parlance
is called genius. Fortunately for the good of mankind, great
gifts and powers of mind are not indispensable to our happiness
or to a safe and salutary development of social conditions.</p>

<p>Patient industry and impregnable virtue are the essential
cardinal qualities that make the man, in the vast majority of
cases, worthy of love and honor, and which conserve the best
interests of the world.</p>

<p>That man who in his career and relations to society has gone
on from day to day and from trust to trust, never disappointing
but always realizing every just expectation, it seems to me is
the character who deserves of his fellow-men the highest meed
<span class='pagenum'>[91]<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>of praise, and gives in his person and example the surest guaranty
that the world will be all the better for his agency in
shaping its affairs.</p>

<p>The friends of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> enjoy the perfect assurance that in
every walk of life, on every occasion when duty called him,
his responses were ever marked by a dignified and intelligent
performance of the tasks assigned him.</p>

<p>What higher honor can we ask for him than this: that weighty
as were the responsibilities that devolved upon him by inheritance
and high as the expectations which were the natural implications
of this inheritance, he fully and nobly met them.
Much as was expected of him, he more than realized the claims
and obligations of a noble lineage. His fellow-citizens and his
contemporaries regard his career as an honor and his companionship
as a delight and a resource that adds poignancy to their
grief in the loss of so loved and valued a friend.</p>

<p>I might refer to the incidents of his military career to illustrate
his courage and fidelity, but it may not be considered appropriate
to the time and the occasion. It is cheering, however,
to believe that in this exalted body there is not to be found
that spirit of truculent uncharitableness which refuses any credit
to an honorable adversary.</p>

<p>Time, which touches all things with mellowing hand, has
softened the recollections of past contests, and they who looked
upon him as a foe now only remember the glory of the fight,
and would join hands with us to weave the garland of his fame.</p>

<p>Securely may the friends and admirers of this noble character
rest in the belief that his name for generations to come will be
enrolled in the glorious list of worthies that has for all time
made the name of Virginia illustrious and among the foremost
of all the commonwealths of the ages past.</p>

<h2><a name="Address_of_Mr_Butler_of_South_Carolina" id="Address_of_Mr_Butler_of_South_Carolina"></a><span class="smcap">Address of Mr. Butler, of South Carolina.</span></h2>


<p>It was my good fortune, Mr. President, to know Gen. <span class="smcap">William
H.F. Lee</span> with the intimacy of personal friendship for more
than a quarter of a century, and I can pass no higher encomium
upon him than by saying he had all the qualities that constitute
a true gentleman, a gentleman in the highest and best
sense. He inherited from a very illustrious and distinguished
ancestry a prestige rarely enjoyed in this country, and yet he
was as unpretending, unaffected, and modest as the humblest
man. His self-contained dignity of character never deserted
him. His placid, well-balanced, well-poised equanimity always
sustained him.</p>

<p>It would be extravagant to say he inherited the commanding
abilities of his illustrious father, but it would be entirely
within the line of a just criticism to affirm that he did inherit
many of the highest characteristics and qualities of that great
man. In personal demeanor, in that suave, gracious, considerate,
self-respecting, and respectful bearing which give assurance
of the perfect gentleman he very much resembled his
father. He was always approachable and cordial, and yet I
doubt if any man ever attempted an improper liberty or ventured
undue familiarity with him. His high character and
affability of manner protected him against such relations.</p>

<p>In the late civil war we served side by side in the same cavalry
corps in the same army almost continuously from the
beginning to the end. I therefore had the best opportunities
of forming a correct estimate of him as a soldier and man, and
it is within the bounds of just judgment to place him among
<span class='pagenum'>[93]<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>the most distinguished in that brilliant array of American soldiers
and men of that eventful period.</p>

<p>I recall with vivid recollection my first association with him
at Ashland, Va., in June, 1861, where he was stationed as a
young captain of cavalry at a school of instruction. Thence he
rose by regular gradations to major-general of division, resigning
his sword with that rank.</p>

<p>Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> never aspired to be what is sometimes called a
"dashing" soldier. He was quite content with the serious,
earnest, steady performance of his duties. It would be no compliment
to say that a son of Robert E. Lee and grandson of
"Light-Horse" Harry Lee had courage. Such a quality is a
necessary ingredient of such a man's character. But his courage
was not of that frothy, noisy kind so often paraded to attract
attention. In battle he was as steady, firm, and immovable as
any soldier who ever wielded a sword or placed a squadron in
the field. In his relations to his subordinates he was the perfection
of military propriety, always considerate and kindly,
but firm and impartial in the enforcement of discipline.</p>

<p>Towards his equals and superiors in rank he bore himself
with a knightly chivalry that at once commanded respect and
confidence. How could he have been otherwise, descended
from such a noble sire, with such an example of courtly dignity
and untarnished manhood?</p>

<p>After the close of hostilities, having discharged his whole
duty as he understood it with fidelity and courage, he retired
to his native State, to his farm, and there, by the same quiet,
honorable, manly course of conduct devoted himself to the
duties of civil life, establishing by his example a standard of
citizenship worthy the great Republic to which he renewed his
allegiance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[94]<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>The people of the Commonwealth of Virginia could not and
did not permit a man of his exalted character, sound intellectual
qualities, and safe, conservative judgment to remain in private
life. His services and example were too valuable to the public,
and he was called into the public service, first as senator in the
State legislature, later into the lower House of Congress.</p>

<p>There, as elsewhere, he soon took rank among the wisest
and safest legislators in the body pursuing the even, modest
tenor of his way with that faithful regard for his duty to his
constituents and his country that characterized every relation
and position of his life.</p>

<p>Those of us, Mr. President, who were favored with his
acquaintance recall with a respect bordering on reverence his
commanding figure as he came in this Chamber, his courtly
presence, his gentle bearing, persuasive conversation, amiable,
respectful manners. The consciousness that we shall never see
him again is a sad and depressing reflection, and a mournful
reminder that it is only a question of time&mdash;how long mortal
man can not foretell&mdash;when those of us who survive him must
obey a similar summons, and disappear, as he has done, from
the scenes of life forever.</p>

<p>In paying tributes of respect and affection to departed friends
I know how hard it is to impose restraint upon our partiality
for them and how strong the temptation to indulge in expressions
of exaggerated eulogy. Knowing Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> as I did, I
can say of him with absolute sincerity and truth that he was as
free from the small and petty faults of our nature as any man I
have ever known. In his private relations he was literally
without guile or deceit. Straightforward, honorable, just in all
his dealings, he was a model citizen and faithful friend.</p>

<p>In his public life he proved himself equal to every station.<span class='pagenum'>[95]<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
Zealous, attentive, conscientious, untiring, he met every responsibility
with fidelity and confidence. He never disappointed
a friend, betrayed a trust, or took unfair advantage of
an opponent. In a word, Mr. President, he lived a perfect
gentleman, discharged faithfully every duty of life, and died
honored and beloved by his friends.</p>

<p>Others have spoken of the life and character of this distinguished
man more in detail, more eloquently, with more finished
oratory, but I yield to none in the sincerity of my humble
tribute to his memory.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Address_of_Mr_Dolph_of_Oregon" id="Address_of_Mr_Dolph_of_Oregon"></a><span class="smcap">Address of Mr. Dolph, of Oregon.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">President</span>: The echoes of the voices of those who
pronounced eulogies upon the life and character of the late
distinguished Senator from Kansas have hardly died away in
this Chamber, and we have again laid business aside to pay our
tributes to the memory of a late honored member of the House
of Representatives and a distinguished son of Virginia.</p>

<p>These sorrowful occasions, which are deprecated by some
as involving a loss of the time of the Senate and needless
expense to the Government, I can not think are unprofitable to
us or to the country. Surely in the mad rush and hurry of
business we may be permitted to halt long enough to take
notice of the invasion of our ranks by death and to voice our
esteem for a departed member. The death of an eminent member
of the Senate or of the House is not only a loss to his
immediate constituency, but to the whole country, and, in
accordance with a long and honored usage, demands from his
former associates formal and appropriate action.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[96]<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>After such an hour spent in the contemplation of the common
end of all that live, in introspection and retrospection,
who of us does not again take up the burdens of life with
renewed resolutions to redouble our energies to faithfully
discharge every public and private duty.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with Mr. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was not intimate. I frequently
met him socially, but he did not belong to the party
with which I am affiliated, and no fortuitous circumstance occurred
to bring us together in the discharge of public duties.
The incidents of his life, his public services, and his domestic
relations have been fittingly alluded to by others, and it only
remains for me to cast an evergreen upon his grave, to add my
poor tribute to his memory, and give expression to the emotions
awakened by the occasion and the exercises of the hour.
Coming from a long line of distinguished ancestors, serving
with marked distinction in the Confederate army until the
cause he championed was hopelessly lost, honored by the people
of his State by election to high civil positions, in which he
did credit to himself and honored them with a rounded character
and well-developed manhood, at once the incarnation of
gentleness, tenderness, and courage, it is not to be wondered
at that sorrow for his death hung over his State like a funeral
pall, and all parties vied with each other in giving expression
to the universal sense of private and public loss.</p>

<p>He was the son of a distinguished sire, who in life was the
idol of the people of Virginia; but he was held in the highest
esteem by the people of his State not so much on account of
his illustrious father as on account of his own ability and
worth. His public services and his blameless life, touching,
tender, and beautiful, won the tributes to his memory pronounced
by his colleagues at the other end of this Capitol.<span class='pagenum'>[97]<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
Fortunate, indeed, is the man who can win such admiration
from his associates.</p>

<p>What higher eulogy can be pronounced on any man than
that in every station, public and private, he was true to himself
and faithful to the people and was equal to the duties of
his station? Not every man can become great; genius is the
gift of the few, but goodness and fidelity to duty are within
the reach of all. He has gone the way of all the living. He
has found the level of the grave. Our words of eulogy can
not reach him there.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Can honor's voice provoke the silent dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or flatt'ry soothe the dull, cold ear of death?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Solomon, summing up this question, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither
have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</p>

<p>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they
any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</p></div>

<p>To human reason the death of him we mourn was untimely.
He was born May 31, 1837, and died October 15, 1891. He
was therefore in the prime of manhood, and apparently had
many years of useful life before him. But death sometimes
strangely selects his victims. No season, no station, no age is
exempt from his fatal shafts. When death comes to the aged
as the end of a fully completed life we regard it as natural.
But when death comes to the young, the gifted, and the promising,
we with our finite vision look upon it as sad and mysterious.
We are constantly reminded that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Await alike the inevitable hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The paths of glory lead but to the grave.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[98]<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>It is creditable to our humanity that at the grave animosities
are buried, and those who speak of the dead remember their
virtues and pass over their frailties.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Death is a mighty mediator. There all the flames of rage are extinguished, hatred
is appeased, and angelic pity, like a weeping sister, bends with gentle and close embrace
over the funeral urn.</p>

<p>The reconciling grave swallows distinction first that made us foes; there all lie
down in peace together.</p></div>

<p>To the grave, "the world's sweet inn from pain and wearisome
turmoil," we are all hastening. Earth's highest station
and meanest place ends in the common receptacle to which we
shall all be taken. Dark and gloomy indeed would be the
grave without a hope in a personal immortality, a belief that
the soul survives the body, and that to this immortal part the
tomb is the gate to heaven. When one feels like Theodore
Parker when he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When this stiffened body goes down to the tomb, sad, silent, and remorseless, I feel
there is no death for the man. That clod which yonder dust shall cover is not my
brother. The dust goes to its place; man to his own. It is then I feel my immortality.
I look through the grave into heaven. I ask no miracle, no proof, no reasoning
for me; I ask no risen dust to teach me immortality. I am conscious of eternal
life.</p></div>

<p>Or like Byron when he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I feel my immortality oversweep all pains, all tears, all time, all fears, and peal,
like the eternal thunders of the deep into my ears this truth&mdash;thou livest forever!</p></div>

<p>Death loses its terrors and the grave becomes a welcome goal
for weary and buffeted mariners on life's stormy sea&mdash;the gate
to endless life.</p>

<p>By these oft-repeated scenes in this Chamber; by the frequent
visits of the stern messenger to both Houses of Congress
to summon a member from his field of labor here to the bar
of the Supreme Ruler of the Universe above; by the constant
changes going on around us in obedience to the inevitable law
<span class='pagenum'>[99]<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>of nature, by which death everywhere succeeds to life, we are
reminded that we shall not long continue as we now are. It is
possible that as we are startled by the announcement of the
death of an associate we mentally ask ourselves, Who will be
called next?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So live, that when thy summons comes to join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The innumerable caravan which moves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that mysterious realm where each shall take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chamber in the silent halls of death,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave<br /></span>

<h2><a name="Address_of_Mr_Daniel_of_Virginia" id="Address_of_Mr_Daniel_of_Virginia"></a><span class="smcap">Address of Mr. Daniel, of Virginia.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">President</span>: The late Gen. <span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span> was conspicuously
connected with the public affairs of his State for more
than thirty years. He was deservedly honored, loved, and
trusted by the people. For two terms he represented the Eighth
district of Virginia in Congress and he was elected for a third
term, but when Congress met in December last his chair was
vacant. Surrounded by his beloved family and bemoaned by
all who knew him he peacefully breathed his last at Ravensworth,
his home, in Fairfax County, on the 15th day of October,
1891.</p>

<p>Thus, Mr. President, disappears one singularly endowed with
the qualities that win the confidence and affections of mankind.
His noble, honest face, beaming with intelligence and
benevolence, was a true index to his nature. Strength of character
and sweetness of disposition made him a man of mark
<span class='pagenum'>[100]<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>and influence in all the relations of society. His life was full
of noble uses. Respect for the rights and tenderness for the
feelings of others stamped his conduct on every occasion. He
fulfilled Sidney's definition of a gentleman, "high thoughts
seated in a heart of courtesy," and I know of no better legacy
that a father could leave his household or a patriot leave his
country than such a record as he has left to attest his virtues.</p>

<p>I will not penetrate the sanctity of the home bereaved by
his death. The fond and noble wife and the sons who miss
the husband and father, who was representative to them of
life's dearest boons, have in his memory whatever earth can
give them of consolation, and they learned from none more
than from him to look above in sorrow and affliction.</p>

<p>As a Representative in Congress Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was diligent in
the service of his constituents and in behalf of policies which
commended themselves to his favor. He seldom spoke, but it
was not because he could not speak well and forcibly. He was
not noted as the peculiar champion of any of the great measures
before Congress, but it was not because he did not comprehend
them nor take great interest in them, and I doubt if there be
many Representatives who have had a more wholesome or further-reaching
influence.</p>

<p>His fine character and engaging manner made friends for him
and for his people. His excellent judgment had great weight
in council, his political ideas were eminently liberal, and his
tact and attention reached results where perhaps more aggressive
qualities would have been ineffectual. On one occasion
that I recall he was urging the passage of the bill to pay for
use and occupation of the Theological Seminary near Alexandria
during the war. He became the mark, in doing so, of
inquiry and badinage, and some one, meaning to disparage the
<span class='pagenum'>[101]<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>claim by intimation that the clerical professors of the institution
had been enemies of the Government, called out to him,
"How did they pray?" He answered instantly, "For all sinners."
His ready pleasantry put everybody in good humor
and the bill was passed.</p>

<p>Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was a representative man in a larger sense than
that of official designation. He was a representative country
gentleman, and the flavor of his native soil was in his character.
He was born in the country, at beautiful Arlington, with the
woods and fields and streams and mountain vistas around him.
He lived in the country all his life, and died in the country, at
his home in Fairfax County, an owner of land, loving the land;
his home, a fine old country seat of colonial pattern, the scene
of domestic peace and love and hospitality; his voice, that of
the good people of his vicinage; his life, daily tasks, intermingled
with daily studies and contemplation; his aims, those of
the patriot and Christian, his country, God, and truth.</p>

<p>Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was a representative American of broad gauge and
vision. Many of us&mdash;and I have felt myself amongst them&mdash;are
quite provincial. We know our own neighborhoods and their
people, and we grow slowly into knowledge of other sections
and their people. Local caste, prejudice, interest, and bias warp
us and minify our usefulness. Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was not of this kind.
There was no sectionalism in his caste, no bigotry in his creeds.
His strong local attachments, natural to a true nature, neither
dwarfed his opinions, soured his reflections, nor darkened his
vision. His was a ripe mind and his a generous nature. He
understood men, because he understood mankind. He had respect
for all men, because he respected manhood. He dealt considerately
and justly with all men of all races, creeds, opinions,
and aspirations, because he respected men and because he had a
<span class='pagenum'>[102]<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>good man's sympathy, with the hopes of his race, his country,
and humanity.</p>

<p>I would not speak of him as a brilliant man. He was more.
He was a wise and good and true man. Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was a representative
of our racial history. The story of his family began
when his remote ancestor rode with the Norman knights at
Hastings. Another led a company of English volunteers with
C&oelig;ur de Lion on the third crusade to the Holy Land, and was
made the Earl of Litchfield. Still another was that Richard
Lee who, intense loyalist as he was, became a commissioner
from Virginia and urged Charles II to fly for refuge to the Old
Dominion when his throne was trembling under him. Quarrel
and fight as we may and as our fathers did before us, the continuity
of race achievement is unbroken.</p>

<p>The growth of race ascendency and the expanse of race domination
are unceasing. The picture is unique and the nation one,
however the theater enlarges, however the scenes shift, however
the actors differ in the drama. Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was a representative
democrat or republican, for I use the words in their generic
sense. His grandfather was that young American Capt. Henry
Lee, the ardent youth of nineteen, who at the head of his company
of Virginia horse reported to Washington for duty when
the first army of Continentals were ranging themselves upon
the plains of Boston. He was the first to break the record of
his line for loyalty to the Crown of England in espousing the
cause of American independence, the first to draw his sword
for the new king proclaimed at Philadelphia&mdash;the sovereign
people.</p>

<p>As "Light-Horse Harry" Lee he goes down to history and
renown; distinguished in general orders of the army and in
promotion from Congress for one exploit, and for another with
<span class='pagenum'>[103]<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>the thanks of Congress and a gold medal. In statesmanship as
in soldiership, he was the friend and follower of Washington.
In the Virginia legislature, when the resolutions of 1798 were
debated, he took sides against them, and in his speech you may
find nearly all the arguments which are used in favor of the
Federal construction of the Constitution. When Washington
died he was a member of Congress, and pronounced upon him
the memorable words, "First in war, first in peace, and first in
the hearts of his fellow-citizens." He was one of those virile
men who could write, speak, and fight.</p>

<p>When Gen. Winfield Scott led the American Army to Mexico
there rode by his side Capt. Robert E. Lee, the son of
Henry Lee, an officer of engineers upon his staff. He was four
times brevetted for gallant conduct and came back famous.
When Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston led the Utah expedition in
1858 there marched on foot in his columns Lieut. <span class="smcap">William
Henry Fitzhugh Lee</span>, the son of Robert E. Lee. He was
not a soldier by education, but by instinct. A graduate of
Harvard College and the stroke oar of his class, he was well
prepared for military life, and the third of his line to bear arms
for the United States. But no war ensued; the canker of a long
peace was settling on military aspirations.</p>

<p>Lieut. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> resigned, married, and settled on his farm, the
White House, on the Pamunkey. With the prattle of little
children around his knees and pastoral scenes before him, his
prospects were those of domestic tranquillity and joy.</p>

<p>What a rush was there to the standards when war broke out in
1861! Americans acted like Americans. They divided in conviction.
They did not differ as to the method of dealing with
conviction. To divide was the propulsion of conditions, to fight
the law of blood. Not one of the Lees had provoked war, but
<span class='pagenum'>[104]<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>not one stood back. The whole family of Lees became representative
soldiers of their people; Gen. Robert E. Lee commanded
the greatest of the Southern armies and his brother
became an admiral of the Southern navy. His sons and
nephews were soldiers and sailors.</p>

<p>The nephew of Northern identity kept place with the North.
The more numerous class of Southern identity kept place with
the South; the boy, a private in the ranks or cadet on shipboard,
the young men leading companies and regiments and
winning brigades and divisions, the sire and chief commanding
all. Their names are interwoven with war's dread story and
splendid deed. Not one had any reproach; not one struck a
blow below the belt. The woman, the child, the captive found
a fortress in the hand of Lee, the foeman met his peer. The
history of two continents and many centuries was written over
again on fields of blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William H.F. Lee</span> raised a company of cavalry at the beginning
of the war and surrendered as a major-general of cavalry at
Appomattox. He fought his way to his rank and suffered all
of war's vicissitudes save death. His men believed in him and
followed him. He was wounded; he was twice a prisoner; he
was held as a hostage in solitary confinement with death impending.
His wife and his children died while he lay wounded
and in prison. Whatever man may suffer he suffered to the
uttermost. Amongst his first acts when he emerged from
prison was to visit, shake hands with and congratulate the
Federal officer for whom he had been held as hostage. He was
a representative Christian, void of vindictiveness and uncomplaining;
he made no outcry of pain; he sealed his lips to
reproach.</p>

<p>I knew him well, respected him profoundly, and loved him
<span class='pagenum'>[105]<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>dearly. I have often heard him speak at gatherings of old
soldiers and on a variety of occasions; sometimes those of turbulence.
I have marveled at his self-poise and reserved
power. Never once did I hear him say ill of any man, nor
allude to his own sufferings or deeds, nor utter words of bitterness.
He took his lot as it came to him, as a man who does
the best he can and leaves the rest to the Disposer of events.
His conscience and his human sympathy, like his soldiership,
were instincts, and his Christian creed was the sum of his
intuitions. Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> was a representative of the times in
which he lived, eccentric in no opinion, even-tempered, wise,
cautious, prudent, steadfast, and gentle; he sought to be useful
rather than to shine. He took deep and active interest in all
that concerned his State.</p>

<p>As a State senator he could be relied upon to support liberal
and progressive measures; as president of the State Agricultural
Society he did much to excite interest and develop improvements;
as a trustee or visitor to educational institutions he
rendered valuable practical service to the cause of popular
enlightenment. In political life he had sharp contests; friend
was surprised and opponent discouraged when emergency
brought forth the reserve forces of his character and ability.
If modesty cloaked his powers in retirement, opposition elicited
them; and the fluency, tact, and ability with which he
discussed issues and met exigencies were remarkable in one
whose experiences of early life had separated him from civil
pursuits and training.</p>

<p>If I have spoken of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>'s ancestral distinctions, it was
not because either he or his people have ever presumed upon
them. On the contrary, no people whom I have ever known
have rested less of claim upon their antecedents or less sought
<span class='pagenum'>[106]<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>to substitute reminiscences for achievements. The independent,
honest, and simple Republicans and Democrats of our country
justly despise a pretender who boasts the shadow of a name;
but that of which the individual may not boast becomes his
country's pride; and I count it great glory to our country that
its institutions have nourished and the highest characteristic
of our race that it has produced successive generations of men
who preserve the continuity of sterling virtues. I count also
as the star of hope for this grand Republic that a distinguished
soldier of a lost cause becomes the beloved statesman
of the cause that won, and finds around him the old-time
comrades and old-time foes, all his friends and each other's
friends united in the service of our common country.</p>

<p>No nobler words have been spoken of the late Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> than
by soldiers who fought against him, and I respond to them with
honor and praise. The production of men who may maintain
the rights their fathers won, and ever grow in liberal thought,
noble character, and worthy achievement is the highest mission
of republican institutions. From Hastings, A.D. 1066, to
Boston in 1776, the name of Lee was blended with the glories
of our fatherland. But from Boston to Appomattox it grew
the more illustrious with grander opportunities. Victorious
through a track of eight hundred years to the 9th of April, 1865,
it has been still more victorious since&mdash;rising to the height of
harder trials and sterner tasks and grander duties than those of
leading embattled lines. The glorious nation of which he was
a type and the glorious band of which he was the son come
forth from ruin and desolation on one side, moved by gracious
institutions and magnanimous sentiments upon the other, taking
their place in the reunited columns of parted friendship,
cementing anew by adaptive virtues the broken ties, marching
<span class='pagenum'>[107]<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>again with the mutual magnanimities of companionship at the
head of column.</p>

<p>If a race that has won liberty and made it a birthright lets it
slip away through hands of weakness or deeds of folly, and if
the self-made man of to-day loses the vantage ground of his
life work with his fleeting breath, the careers of nations would
be brief, the story of liberty would be a nurse's tale, and the
careers of individuals would be vanity of vanities. The prepotent
blood that made an empire of an insignificant island
and stamped its language and its laws upon it made also here
the most splendid Republic of the earth out of a savage wilderness
and assimilated to itself all tributaries. That Republic
delegates its unfinished tasks to a posterity that will lift higher
the monuments of its greatness and strengthen the foundations
of its endurance; and in the lives of Gen. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> and those of his
worthy compatriots of all sections who unite as friends the
moment conditions cease that made them foes, I see exemplified
the noblest qualities of our kind and read the auguries of
prolonged peace, progress, happiness, and stability.</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Vice-President</span>. The question is on agreeing to the
resolutions submitted by the Senator from Virginia.</p>

<p>The resolutions were agreed to unanimously, and under the
last resolution the Senate (at 4 o'clock and 20 minutes p.m.)
adjourned until Monday, March 7, 1892, at 12 o'clock m.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
